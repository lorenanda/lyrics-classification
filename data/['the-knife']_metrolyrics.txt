One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor bladeTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me, noOne night of magic rush
The start: a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in loveTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me, ohTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meAnd you
You knew the hand of the devil
And you
Kept us awake with wolves' teeth
Sharing different heartbeats in one nightTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meI'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by to see him again
And when you two danced
oh what a dance
And when you two laughed
oh what a laugh
Has he mentioned my age, love?Or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair
I'm in love with your brother
I'd thought I'd come byI'm in love with your brother
Yes, I am but maybe I
shouldn't ask for his name
and you danced
oh what a dance
and you laughed
oh what a laugh
Does he know what I do andYou pass this on, won't you and
If I asked him once what would he say
Is he willing, can he play?
I wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor and
does he know what I do and
you pass this on, won't you and?I wasn't really looking for some more than

I wasn't really looking for some more than some company on the dancefloor and...I cut your nails and comb your hair
I carry you down the stairs
I wanted to see right through from the other side
I wanted to walk a trail with no end in sightThe moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love it's easy to forget
When we are all alone then we do both agree
We have a thing in common this was meant to beYou close my eyes and soothe my ears
You heal my wounds and dry my tears
On the inside of this marble house I grow
And the seeds I sow will grow up prisoners tooThe moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love it's easy to forget
When we are all alone then we do both agree
We have a thing in common this was meant to beNow where's your shoulder
What is its name
What's your scent
Say it againIf it goes faster can you still follow me
It must be safe when it's on TVI raise my hands to heaven for curiosity
I don't know what to ask for
What has it got for me
The others say we're hiding
It's as forward as can be
Some things I do for money
Some things I do for freeFuu!
I got to got to let you down
But in an hour I will change my mind.

To the endRumous telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.If we say that there is something above the mountains
if we say that there is something we can't see.
Promise you will never believe me
cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easyAnd you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.Everybody was laughing when they found us
one for you and one for me.
Then they let us go to hunt us down again
and still you refuse to see
why everything has to stay uglyRumous telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.We were looking for a room
We were looking for a hotel
We were in between
We were a few chosen
Somewhere to fit in
Something that's fitting
After one day it started itching
And we rubbed until it was bleedingAnd we ran through the moonlight far beyond
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyondWe were looking for something to blow up
We were looking for someone to follow
We had one way out
We had some hours left
We were so close
We knew we were chosen
We aimed for high speed
And for someone who could catch meAnd we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyondWe were looking for a room
We were looking for something to blow up
We knew we were chosen
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyondEyes are sober and this is the plan
I'm sitting in a car heading Neverland
A fancy man a fancy man
He's pointing with the fingers that are left on his handEyes are hazel but far too cold
Looking out for love
But none of us can
Where's the monkey that I've been told of
I'm staring at the money
That burns in my hand
I'm dancing for dollars
And for a fancy manCome right over
I'll knock on your shoulder
This is a story and this is what I've planned
An angry man an angry man
Nothing is more fatal than an angry manVulnerable heights
Feed the hand that bites me
Following the steam into another room
Standing in the corner
Is this my home
Showing us love that none of us can
I'm singing for money
That burns in my handTell me
Will I make it home tonightI'm doing it for dollars and for a fancy man
I've got a lot of money that burns in my handI am a cop, shut up
I piss in your mouthI am a cop, shut up
I shoot you in the face motherfucker
I piss in your mouthI am a cop, shut up
I shoot you right on the spot
You motherfucking shitThe doctor came in the morning
She held my hand
And asked "was it worth it?"
"Could it be worse than this?"
Please recall
Give me a hint
Anything will do
If this was the last time now you should tell us what to doI was afraid I guess
Now I can't think no more
I was so concentrated
On keeping things together
I've learned to focus on
I didn't want to disappoint
Now where is everybody
Is it still light outside?No more tears and you'll be fine
I stay here all night
And when I've stayed all night
We go out in the morning lightAnd then you try to live the day
I don't know how, but I know what to say
Is it medicine or social skill
Don't have the answer and nobody will
You go screaming on without a word
Being sad is a fulltime work
And now the day has come to an end
And then you start to cry againIs it medicine?
Is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
Is it medicine, is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?I never knew this could happen to me
I know now fragility
I know there's people who I haven't told
I know of people who are getting oldWish I could speak in just one sweep
What you are and what you mean to me
Instead I mumble randomly
You stand by and enlighten meIn a dream I lost my teeth again
Calling me woman and half man
Yes in a dream all my teeth fell out
A cracked smile and a silent shout
A cracked smile and a silent shoutIf I explain it once thoroughly
He'll have you later 'cause it's never free
You were at the gigantic spree
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me
I caught a glimpse now it haunts meSharpen my body like a pen
Come on I need to show it
Something too small for a lense
If I rub it, if I wipe itGuiding with one single hand
Nothing's wrong, you like the feeling
I am all over the land
Come on, I need to show itBack on the mountain again
I was standing watching seasons
You're now my only friend
I'm too heavy, I'm the burdenSitting and picking on myself
It's a shiny, shiny morning
And when the light finds my eye
I'll be fleeting like a scentI hold my breath and then count to three
On and on, outworn
Must be five hundred degrees
Can't sail on, outwornI hold my breath and then count to three
On and on, outworn
Must be five hundred degrees
Will it show, in my showWho's wrong but fair?
Who's wrong but fair?
As I move down the street
As I walk block block
As I move down the street
As I walk block block
Use all of me (x10)
Oh
Oh move
Stay out here
Stay out here
Is this happening?
They make it worthless, it will be
It's now when they dance
Just so, just now, the euro falls
Our short century
Time Square
I know the last
You and me
Are you on your way?
Just so just how I hear a call
Our short century
You have the most I wait to engrave
You've put my foot in front of the other
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
Stay out here
Stay out here
Is this happening?
That breaks my band, what's left for us all?
You stand down, pinball
And this time, this time this time time
What is remember?
We hate too much
How to stay in doubt
You have the most beautiful way
Of putting one foot in front of the other
You know that sometimes it's from the fall
Those things we love are open indeed
Stay out here
Stay out here
You sure will love me
Most things we love are open in this
They are here
We're more friendly
Lose your way, your way
Lose your way, your way
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Most things you love are open in this
They are here
We're more friendly
Use all of me
Use all of me

As I make shape of it so long
Just won't go back
Walk walk walk
Blop blop blopI keep my dick hangin' out of my pants

I was chosen by standard procedures
and I'll assure you I don't mind.I'm the head over small buissness

nÃ¤e, vi stoppar dÃ¤r.A handful of elf pee
That's my soul
spray it all over
fill the bowl
legs astride
an axe to grind
generous actions with the speed of lightWithout you my life would be boringUnder the iceberg
there's a tomb
working the way up
Picking a hole in the cocoon
A bucket of tiger pee
come with me
bottoms up
reaching a dreamWithout you my life would be boringWhat if we can't make it but we say that we can
Shaking the habitual
relate it to time
we're laughing at the future and we cry 'bout the past
I'm holding on forever but how long will forever last?Without you my life would be boringThe piss is territorialWhat if we can't make it but we say that we can
Shaking the habitual

we're laughing at the future and we cry 'bout the past
I'm holding on forever but how long will forever last?Without you my life would be boringIn the middle of nowhere
when we're looking for something
then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a wonderer
and I welcomed the dew as much as you didWhen we're looking for brushwood
in the nearest neighbourhood
then we follow the sky with the eye
we search vegetation
and surprised by the rain
we're stumbling, tripping home againIn the middle of nowhere
when we're looking for something
then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a walker
and I welcomed the dew as much as you didWe found the little man
and his aeroplane
but we never located the animal
Examined the dirty ground
like it never been done
Modern exploring of 1991Coming home after a long long walk
Coming home after a dozen of walks
Coming home after a long long war
Coming home after a dozen of warsWe are out of wind
We have pock-marked chin
We have lots of water
We turn the other cheek and we winOne thousand stories and there's always more
We've been offered one more lap to go
In my hand I hold a key
It's dear to me cause I know where it leadsWe are out of wind
We have pock-marked chin
We have all this water
We turn the other cheek and we grinHear my troubles of mine
Can you take me for one last ride
I want to bend my soul again
That's what we do when we get older
Where's your troubled mind
You've got your money and you got them 'cause others just can't
There's the lottery
About geographyDon't know the hand you're holding
Paying someone to put them to bed againAnd that's when it hurts
The difference
This is hot blood
And a difference
What a difference
A little difference would makeHear my love sigh
I've got a story that money just can't buy
Western standards
Poverty's profitable
See it slip and slide
not just one answer 'cause it's working like parallel lines
It's not that easy
When you want it easyAnd that's when it hurts
When you see the difference
It's a raging lung
And a difference
What a difference
A little difference would makeDon't leave me now
Don't fall asleep
We need to rest sometimes
but don't take long

I was afraid of everything

The horrible cross of an evening queenIf I was a bird
I would fly high over the world
Come home at night to your garden
build a nest among the branches
and I'll comb your hair with my beakIf I was a bird
I would count my time in pearls
Under my wings you'll find shelter
you'll breed bugs and keep me well fed
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to flyBut you wanted me to be a girl
without feathers without urge
then my wings quick dissappeared

I took my hand out of my pocket up came a fist
It was headline news
One more abuse
I've got to tell it with a fist
And it goes like thisHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhSo where's the femininity
The one with skirts and high heels
A shiny sink and home made meals
The one and only way
If you enter you'll stay
Sons and daughters you will breed
As long as you breastfeed
Yeah being a man is a bliss
One Hit one KissHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhThen the lights came on, it was all a scene
Bend back, give head it's not pornography
If you do it with lights then it's art you see
If you do it with a twist
Yes, artisticallyHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhI could do the laundry
The women's work
For a reasonable salary I would wash the world
It wouldn't affect my libido or my self esteem
Don't need to mark my territory
It's all obvious to me
It's manhood's bliss
One Hit one Kiss
Spending time with my family
Like the CorleonesHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhSomething's got a hold of my head

But you could have waited (waited)I look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about deathI look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about deathWaited
Waited
WaitedToo far away from the city
Some kids left on the road
They said we have a communist in the family
I had to wear a maskToo far away from the city
We had to make this room
Fathers were football players, formal works, policemen
What the mothers did I didn't knowMusic tonight
I just want your music tonightI saw her body organ
She was laughing while pressing the keys
She said my favourite book was dirty and
"You shouldn't shout, you can read."Too far away from the city
We never heard its noise
We learned how to stay fit and things like
Green-tones hide the blushMusic tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonightToo far away from the city
We came to breathe clean air
Nature left a safe oasis
And the mothers walked towards the forestMusic tonight
I just want your music tonight
Music tonight
I just want your music tonightSometimes I get problems that are hard to solve
