Drifting further, every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one elseI have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me freeThings not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feelEmptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness, taking dawn
I was me, but now he's goneNo one but me
Can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Bye...I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops meNow that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meBack in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll liveFed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meNow the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help meDarkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellEnd of passion play, crumbling away

Or the devil he may take yaI took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
And I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me
No never would she leave me
But devil take that woman!

Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open

'Cause you're unforgiven tooOn a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page

I'm youSad but trueHow could he know this new dawn's light, would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure
Was he the one, causing pain, With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid, Of the things he's feeling
He
could
just
be
gone
He
would justsail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive.
And how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog, It's thick and suffocatingHis seeking life outside its hell, Inside intoxicatingHe's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
...a...
castaway
They've
all goneaway
They've gone awayHow can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?, When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive meForgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me notForgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light, Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally derangedDream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarredSleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rageSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me aloneBuild my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insaneThey think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hellSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, (just leave me alone)
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out againBorn to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the groundMouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waitingWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comesPush you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your timeGod, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grayWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comesLove is a four-letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four-letter word
Here in this prisonI suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swearMake his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men on five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely knowFor whom the bell tolls
Time marches onFor whom the bell tollsTake a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsAnd the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I craveOnly knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave

Told me when i was young
"son your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what i heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But i must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Yeah still
Rebel mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what i heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now i'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all i see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Let this heart be stillOn a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you knowThere's a feeling, deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling, of a hammerhead
You need it oh so badAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really soreIn a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonightAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nearsNow's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we chooseAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacHere we go!(1st solo)Whiplash!(2nd solo)
The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
We'll never stop, we'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

So fucking what! Yeah!Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidityOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own wayRape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sightOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own wayThe window burns to light the way back homeA light that warms, no matter where they've goneThey're off to find the hero of the dayBut what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?Still the window burns, time so slowly turnsSomeone there is sighingKeepers of the flames
Do you feel your names?Can't you hear your babies crying?(Mama, they try and break me)(Still they try and break me)'scuse me while I tend to how I feelThese things return to me that still seem realNow deservingly this easy chairBut the rocking stops by wheels of despairDon't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feelNo I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feelBut now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's lightSo can't you hear your babies crying now?Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams that
ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, the tryBy the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and dieIn the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insaneWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destructGO!On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom designWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destructOH!Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the endWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct

Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honestyInbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the endBlood will follow blood
Dying time is hereDamage incorporatedSlamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we? re the cureHonesty is my only excuse

Don't tread on me(instrumental)(instrumental)My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, Oh the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the wordMoving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friendFreedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside
To each his ownDo you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lieDoesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayIndependence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
(Bridge and solo)
Do you know what I know?Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thingI hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayMy life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fateI give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto meHarvester of sorrow
Language of the madHarvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to meGet back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of painYour loss becomes my gain
Anger, miseryYou'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmaresTo see into my eyes

Like twisted vines that grow
That hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donnaFortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane

Up to lips that time forgetsWhile the Hollywood sun sets behind your backAnd can't the band play on?

Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call lifeDear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspiredInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindlyDear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chanceDear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say not as I doInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly
I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue meDear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knewSpineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You willTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahMarvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We seeTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
and you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahWitchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you followTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye

Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatLie

Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call

Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
It's never as sweet as it seemsLike a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to biteLike a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like Conviction
A Premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny
I denyI blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to dieLike a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a General
Without a mission
Until the war will start again... start again.I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your kneesAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your lifeBodies fill the fields I see
Hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
No one to pretend
Running blind through killing fieldsBred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to careDo just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine gun fireDoes nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
Get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear
Glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clayNow an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take awayBack to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the frontYou coward
You servant
You blind man
Why, am I dying?Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
(Solo)
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lyingHell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth
Nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
Molded day by day
Looking back I realizeNothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Back to the frontIced Honey LyricsYou can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honeyNow me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honeyIf I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honeyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lambIf it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so longIf your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a startAnd me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticksNo matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honeyGirl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now

You Really Got MeSee, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now

Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYou Really Got Me

You Really Got Me
Oh no...(Solo)See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYou Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got MeI am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's darkFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that somethings watching youFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone thereFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the darkWatching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behindFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks aloneYou'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning backThe bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death, oh, ohThe horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fallWe hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day, oh, ohWe get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan, oh, ohI'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running lowRunning lowWhen the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for meCan it be that there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly awayMark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truthWhen you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusionYeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy nameWhite man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains, we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, a stab in the back
Women and children and cowards attack
Run to the hillsRun for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their goldEnslaving the young and destroying the oldRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesWe shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France.
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beaches.
We shall fight on the landing grounds.
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender!Won't you come into my room?
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stareSee the blood begin to flow
As it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought
Iron Maiden can't be soughtOh well, wherever,
wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you
no matter how farSee the blood flow
watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for deadWon't you come into my room?
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stareSee the blood begin to flow
As it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought

Iron Maiden's gonna get you,
no matter how farSee the blood flow,
watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for deadFrom the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travelin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone elseI close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night, ain't it funny how it is
You never miss if til' it's gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be til' my dying daySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsToo much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily, when you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my hands up to the skySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsSo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make this stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsThere goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too lateRunning, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing againBandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving (doing it again)
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding
Reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty sixI left alone,
my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mindWhat did I see?
Can I believe
that what I saw That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I sawin my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dreams
it's always thereThe evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despairNight was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?6
66
the number of the beast
Hell and fire
was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
6

6
the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize
can't avoid their eyes

the one for you and me
I'm coming back
I will return
And I'll possess your body
and I'll make you burn
I have the fire
I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its courseInto the Abyss I'll fall- the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night- watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows- in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a God-
And He will die too.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned-
Marbled in stone.
A shell of a man God preserved-
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from my grave.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...Are you a man of peace
Or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you
Don't know which anymoreSo many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe againA life that's made to breath
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption
Bad or good intentA wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winnerThey fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would knowAnd as He lies in Heaven
Or it could be in Hell
I feel He's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't knowPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isMore pain and misery
In the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blindIt brings upon us more
A famine, death and war
You know religion has
A lot to answer forPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isAnd as they search to find
The bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are
Scattered across the landAnd as the spirits seem
To whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere
Another war beginsAnd all because of it
You'd think that we would learn
But still the body count
The city fires burnSomewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying
Stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me whyPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what ware is
Again, tell me what life isPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isFor the greater good of God

For the greater good of GodHe gave his life for us
He fell upon the Cross
To die for all of those
Who never mourn His lossIt wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me whyWake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a raceThat is part of a clan
And to live on Highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so cleanWhen alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be freeIs it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking whyCan't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the ClansNot alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a ClansmanFreedom, freedom
Freedom, freedomIt's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening nowThey would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has written in chainsAnd I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the ClansmanAnd I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken aliveAnd I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born freeAnd I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want

But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Some blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living deathThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast... YEAH!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babiesThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gunThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all nightMidnight... All night!Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.The albatross begins with it's vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me."Day after day, day after day,
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
All the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?See... onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one."One after one by the star dogged moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one."The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyesAnd revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feetGoing all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight, to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, haha, now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going out
If you kill me, it's self defense
If I kill you then I call it vengeanceSpit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight, to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want toYou'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cos I'll run rings around you

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man

And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm goingLove is a razor and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocenceAnd I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now...

...Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I've never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death
Has come for me?
I can't believe, that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait,

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to tear my body apart
Livin' lovin' I'm on the runSo far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
But she's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Oooh! I'm on the runMaybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Sunrise to sunsetDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of timeSpend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of timeSands are flowing and the lines
are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the
desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsAs the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the stillHis eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gazeFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun, yeah, mmmNow the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God my father, I fly!"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dreamNow he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his graveFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun(Solo)Yeah, fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly(Solo)Fly as high as the sunLet me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of things that I saw.
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more.
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars.
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move.
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees.
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace.
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead.
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led.
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go.
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals.
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me.
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me.
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes.
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of themThey had ascended from hell.
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me.
Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead.
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me.
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me.
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me.
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled.
I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance.
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead.
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it.
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go.
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead.Hand of fate is moving
And the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet
And so what are you gonna doYour tongue has frozen now
You've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn
Is calling you his wayYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breathYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeThe ferryman wants his money
You ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat
As you set up off the trackNothing you can contemplate
Will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark
Sets the universe aflameYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up againYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeuooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo
uoooO God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
But take away our pride.Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this.
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain.
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know.
The Secret of the HangmanThe smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips.
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry.
So we lay in a black embrace
And the Seed is sown in a holy placeAnd I watched and I waited for the Dawn.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
Bind us all together
Ablaze with Hope and Free.
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain.
For the one who will be King
Is the watcher in the Ring.
It is You.C'mon yeahI've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my graspYou've been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false maskAnd you know and I know that
You ain't got long now to lastYour looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your pastYou're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fallKnowing the terror and holding
You have on us allYeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maulYou know I'm helpless
From your mesmerizing cat callUhKeep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray
Don't fade awayWatch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray
From the narrow wayUh, uhh
I'm running and hiding in my dreams
You're always thereYou're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scareYou damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the airYou haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lairFeel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyesI wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength, an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymoreThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingJust by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through you mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demiseThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
And be reborn again?All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemedBut never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despiseThe false smile maketh of the manGlass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truthThere's something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling downTears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drownedTears of a clownWho motivates the motivatorFacade it has to go
He knows it sooner or laterSmile for cameras all okBut tomorrow is another day he must get throughHe had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the bestLay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clownTomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown."My son ask for thyself another
Kingdom, for that which I leaveis too small for thee"
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)
Near to the east
In a part of ancient GreeceIn an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was AlexanderAt the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian SeaIn 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of menAlexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled PersiaThe Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris riverHe met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he foundTook Persepolis the capital of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the GreatBecame a God amongst mortal menA Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of AsiaHelonism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in BabylonAnd if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of meJust for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening againWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersAnd as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnedWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersThere are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the badWill we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own handWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersWhen you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of lifeDying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back homeWilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back homeIt's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky.The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow.Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb.They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest.
They dared to go where no one would to try
They chose to fly where eagles dareWhen I stand before you shining
In the early morning Sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've doneOh the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the
Towns become the ghosts of timeOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged soulsWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayCurving on the edge of daylight
'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
'til the Sun is born againStretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
Speck of dust in cosmic sandOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners stormy gravesWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayTo Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
Coming home far away
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayIn a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of PaschendaleRelive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his yearsLaying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends againIn the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us allWhistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soonMany soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to beginHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againThe bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we goCrucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seenSwear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of PaschendaleCruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry stillI stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we goBlood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on PaschendaleDodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of deathAs we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throatHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againSee my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at PaschendaleBorn into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to beNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
Going to find my man
Gonna travel 'roundSo long wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild
Hello wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeahSome say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find
Some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazyNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel 'round'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeah
YeahIf you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia AvenueMeet a lady that I know, so if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for, everybody's got their viceIf you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it freeSo any time you're down the East End, don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can knowCharlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting diseaseSome day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightCharlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightBeat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with meInfinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins againSomeone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end?
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deepEven though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? Well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?Help me, help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing myself even within my dreamsThere's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again, and again, and again, and again...Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard? Have you heard?He sees them in the distance, when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know? Did you know?As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHave you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?
Have you heard? Have you heard?There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it it will never be the same
Did you know? Did you know?He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never knowThey tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know? Did you know?He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHe sees the picture on the wall it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying GraceRemember times they had they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be goneThey've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will comeThey make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and waitCan't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begunCan't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
When they found them had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blowsSo close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
And nothing else mattersNever opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way

Drifting further, every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one elseI have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me freeThings not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feelEmptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness, taking dawn
I was me, but now he's goneNo one but me
Can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Bye...I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops meNow that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meBack in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll liveFed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meNow the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help meDarkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellEnd of passion play, crumbling away

You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage

Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure
Was he the one, causing pain, With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid, Of the things he's feeling
He
could
just
be
gone
He
would justsail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive.
And how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog, It's thick and suffocatingHis seeking life outside its hell, Inside intoxicatingHe's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
...a...
castaway
They've
all goneaway
They've gone awayHow can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?, When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive meForgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me notForgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light, Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally derangedDream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarredSleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rageSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me aloneBuild my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insaneThey think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hellSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, (just leave me alone)
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out againBorn to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the groundMouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waitingWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comesPush you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your timeGod, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grayWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comesLove is a four-letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four-letter word
Here in this prisonI suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swearMake his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men on five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely knowFor whom the bell tolls
Time marches onFor whom the bell tollsTake a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsAnd the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I craveOnly knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you willBut I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhereAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
And the earth becomes my throne
And the earth becomes my throneI adapt to the unknown, under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone, I ask no oneAnd my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain, off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, But I'll take my time anywhereI'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere

Told me when i was young
"son your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what i heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But i must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Yeah still
Rebel mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what i heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now i'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all i see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Let this heart be stillOn a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you knowThere's a feeling, deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling, of a hammerhead
You need it oh so badAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really soreIn a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonightAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nearsNow's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we chooseAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacHere we go!(1st solo)Whiplash!(2nd solo)
The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
We'll never stop, we'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidityOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own wayRape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sightOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own wayThe window burns to light the way back homeA light that warms, no matter where they've goneThey're off to find the hero of the dayBut what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?Still the window burns, time so slowly turnsSomeone there is sighingKeepers of the flames
Do you feel your names?Can't you hear your babies crying?(Mama, they try and break me)(Still they try and break me)'scuse me while I tend to how I feelThese things return to me that still seem realNow deservingly this easy chairBut the rocking stops by wheels of despairDon't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feelNo I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feelBut now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's lightSo can't you hear your babies crying now?Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams that
ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, the tryBy the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and dieIn the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation

Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...
Don't tread on me(instrumental)(instrumental)My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, Oh the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the wordMoving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friendFreedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside
To each his ownDo you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lieDoesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayIndependence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
(Bridge and solo)
Do you know what I know?Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thingI hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayMy life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fateI give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto meHarvester of sorrow
Language of the madHarvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to meGet back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of painYour loss becomes my gain
Anger, miseryYou'll suffer unto me

And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be thereYou cannot touch me
You would not dare

Back into the past
You are the fish for which I castAnd what of the future
What is to be
As the rivers flow into the seaAnd I try to get through to you
In my own special way

Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lairTime is an illusion,
Rising from time,
Steep is the mountain which we climb.And I try to get through to you,
In my own special way,
As the barriers crumble,
At the end of the dayAnd now I wait my whole lifetime
For you

Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call lifeDear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspiredInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindlyDear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chanceDear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say not as I doInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly
I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue meDear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knewSpineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You willTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahMarvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We seeTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
and you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahWitchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you followTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye

Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatLie

Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymoreFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under iceCrystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I sayFreezing

Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified

Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on meFreezing

Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
It's never as sweet as it seemsLike a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to biteLike a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like Conviction
A Premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny
I denyI blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to dieLike a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a General
Without a mission
Until the war will start again... start again.I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your kneesAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your lifeBodies fill the fields I see
Hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
No one to pretend
Running blind through killing fieldsBred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to careDo just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine gun fireDoes nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
Get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear
Glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clayNow an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take awayBack to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the frontYou coward
You servant
You blind man
Why, am I dying?Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
(Solo)
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lyingHell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth
Nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
Molded day by day
Looking back I realizeNothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Back to the frontIced Honey LyricsYou can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honeyNow me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honeyIf I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honeyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lambIf it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so longIf your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a startAnd me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticksNo matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honeyGirl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now

You got me so I can't sleep at nightYeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYou Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got MeI am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's darkFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that somethings watching youFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone thereFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the darkWatching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behindFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks aloneYou'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning backThe bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death, oh, ohThe horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fallWe hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day, oh, ohWe get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan, oh, ohI'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running lowRunning lowWhen the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for meCan it be that there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly awayMark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truthWhen you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusionYeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy nameWhite man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains, we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, a stab in the back
Women and children and cowards attack
Run to the hillsRun for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their goldEnslaving the young and destroying the oldRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesWe shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France.
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beaches.
We shall fight on the landing grounds.
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender!Won't you come into my room?

I'm travelin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone elseI close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night, ain't it funny how it is
You never miss if til' it's gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be til' my dying daySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsToo much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily, when you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my hands up to the skySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsSo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make this stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsThere goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too lateRunning, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing againBandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving (doing it again)
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding
Reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty sixI left alone,
my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mindWhat did I see?
Can I believe
that what I saw That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I sawin my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dreams
it's always thereThe evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despairNight was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?6
66
the number of the beast
Hell and fire
was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
6
6
6
the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize
can't avoid their eyes

the one for you and me
I'm coming back
I will return
And I'll possess your body
and I'll make you burn
I have the fire
I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its courseInto the Abyss I'll fall- the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night- watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows- in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a God-
And He will die too.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned-
Marbled in stone.
A shell of a man God preserved-
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from my grave.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...Are you a man of peace
Or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you
Don't know which anymoreSo many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe againA life that's made to breath
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption
Bad or good intentA wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winnerThey fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would knowAnd as He lies in Heaven
Or it could be in Hell
I feel He's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't knowPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isMore pain and misery
In the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blindIt brings upon us more
A famine, death and war
You know religion has
A lot to answer forPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isAnd as they search to find
The bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are
Scattered across the landAnd as the spirits seem
To whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere
Another war beginsAnd all because of it
You'd think that we would learn
But still the body count
The city fires burnSomewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying
Stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me whyPlease tell me now what life is

To die for all of those
Who never mourn His lossIt wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me whyWake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a raceThat is part of a clan
And to live on Highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so cleanWhen alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be freeIs it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking whyCan't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the ClansNot alone with a dream

Freedom, freedomIt's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening nowThey would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has written in chainsAnd I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the ClansmanAnd I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken aliveAnd I know that we'll stand

But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Some blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living deathThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast... YEAH!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babiesThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gunThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all nightMidnight... All night!Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.The albatross begins with it's vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me."Day after day, day after day,
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
All the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?See... onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one."One after one by the star dogged moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one."The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyesAnd revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feetGoing all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight, to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, haha, now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going out
If you kill me, it's self defense
If I kill you then I call it vengeanceSpit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight, to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want toYou'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cos I'll run rings around you

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now

'Cos I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm goingLove is a razor and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocenceAnd I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now...

...Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I've never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death
Has come for me?
I can't believe, that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait,

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to tear my body apart
Livin' lovin' I'm on the runSo far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
But she's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Oooh! I'm on the runMaybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Sunrise to sunsetDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of timeSpend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of timeSands are flowing and the lines
are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the
desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsAs the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the stillHis eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gazeFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun, yeah, mmmNow the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God my father, I fly!"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dreamNow he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his graveFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun(Solo)Yeah, fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly(Solo)Fly as high as the sunLet me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of things that I saw.
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more.
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars.
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move.
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees.
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace.
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead.
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led.
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go.
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals.
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me.
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me.
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes.
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of themThey had ascended from hell.
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me.
Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead.
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me.
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me.
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me.
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled.
I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance.
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead.
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it.
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go.
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead.Hand of fate is moving
And the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet
And so what are you gonna doYour tongue has frozen now
You've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn
Is calling you his wayYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breathYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeThe ferryman wants his money
You ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat
As you set up off the trackNothing you can contemplate
Will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark
Sets the universe aflameYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up againYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeuooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo
uoooO God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
But take away our pride.Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this.
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain.
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know.
The Secret of the HangmanThe smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips.
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry.
So we lay in a black embrace
And the Seed is sown in a holy placeAnd I watched and I waited for the Dawn.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
Bind us all together
Ablaze with Hope and Free.
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain.
For the one who will be King
Is the watcher in the Ring.
It is You.C'mon yeahI've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my graspYou've been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false maskAnd you know and I know that
You ain't got long now to lastYour looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your pastYou're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fallKnowing the terror and holding
You have on us allYeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maulYou know I'm helpless
From your mesmerizing cat callUhKeep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray
Don't fade awayWatch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray
From the narrow wayUh, uhh
I'm running and hiding in my dreams
You're always thereYou're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scareYou damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the airYou haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lairFeel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyesI wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength, an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymoreThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingJust by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through you mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demiseThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
And be reborn again?All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemedBut never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despiseThe false smile maketh of the manGlass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truthThere's something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling downTears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drownedTears of a clownWho motivates the motivatorFacade it has to go
He knows it sooner or laterSmile for cameras all okBut tomorrow is another day he must get throughHe had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the bestLay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clownTomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown."My son ask for thyself another
Kingdom, for that which I leaveis too small for thee"
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)
Near to the east
In a part of ancient GreeceIn an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was AlexanderAt the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian SeaIn 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of menAlexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled PersiaThe Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris riverHe met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he foundTook Persepolis the capital of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the GreatBecame a God amongst mortal menA Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of AsiaHelonism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in BabylonAnd if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of meJust for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening againWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersAnd as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnedWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersThere are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the badWill we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own handWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersWhen you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of lifeDying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back homeWilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back homeIt's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky.The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow.Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb.They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest.
They dared to go where no one would to try
They chose to fly where eagles dareWhen I stand before you shining
In the early morning Sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've doneOh the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the
Towns become the ghosts of timeOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged soulsWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayCurving on the edge of daylight
'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
'til the Sun is born againStretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
Speck of dust in cosmic sandOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners stormy gravesWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayTo Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
Coming home far away
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayIn a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of PaschendaleRelive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his yearsLaying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends againIn the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us allWhistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soonMany soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to beginHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againThe bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we goCrucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seenSwear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of PaschendaleCruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry stillI stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we goBlood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on PaschendaleDodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of deathAs we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throatHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againSee my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at PaschendaleBorn into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to beNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
Going to find my man

Yeah I'm a wrathchild
Hello wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeahSome say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find
Some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazyNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel 'round'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeah
YeahIf you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia AvenueMeet a lady that I know, so if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for, everybody's got their viceIf you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it freeSo any time you're down the East End, don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can knowCharlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting diseaseSome day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightCharlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightBeat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with meInfinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins againSomeone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end?
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deepEven though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? Well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?Help me, help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing myself even within my dreamsThere's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again, and again, and again, and again...Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard? Have you heard?He sees them in the distance, when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know? Did you know?As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHave you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?
Have you heard? Have you heard?There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it it will never be the same
Did you know? Did you know?He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never knowThey tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know? Did you know?He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHe sees the picture on the wall it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying GraceRemember times they had they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be goneThey've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will comeThey make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and waitCan't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begunCan't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
When they found them had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blowsto ride the storm to an empire of the cloudsto ride the storm they climbed
aboard their silver ghost
to ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
to ride the storm and damn the rest... oblivion
royalty and dignitaries brandy and cigars
grey lady giant of the skies
you hold them in your arms
the millionth chance they laughed
to take down his majesty's craft
to india they say magic carpet float away
an october fateful day...
mist is in the treesstone sweats with the dew
the morning sunrise red before the blue
hanging at the mast
waiting for command
his majesty's airship
the r101
she's the biggest vessel built by mana giant of the skies
for all you unbelievers
the titanic fits inside
drum roll tight her canvas skin
silvered in the sun
never tested with the fury
with the beating yet to come
the fury yet t o come
in the gathering gloomthe storm rising in the west
the coxswain stared
into the plunging wea therglass
we must go nowwe must take our chance with fate
we must go now
for a politician, he can't be late
the airship crew a wake for thirtyhours at full stretch
but the ship is in their backbone
every sinew every inch
she never flew at full speed
a trial never done
her fragile outer co ver
her achilles would become
an achilles yet t o come
sailors of the skya hardened breed
loyal to the king and an airship creed
the engines drum
the telegraph sounds
release the cords
that bind us to the ground
said the coxswain "sir she's heavy"
"she'll never make this flight"
said the captain "damn the cargo"
"we'll be on our way tonight"
groundlings cheered in wonder
as she backed off from the mast
baptizing them her water
from the ballast fore and aft
now she slips into our past
fighting the wind as it rolls youfeeling the diesels that push you along
watching the channel below you
lower and lower into the night
lights are passing below you
northern france asleep in their beds
storm is ra ging around you
a million to one that's what he said
reaper standing beside herwith his scythe cuts to the bone
panic to make a decision
experienced men asleep in their graves
her cover is ripped and she's drowning
rain is fl ooding into the hull
bleeding to death and she's falling
lifting gas is draining away
"we're down lads" came the crybow plunging from the sky
three thousand horses silent
as the ship began to die
the flares t o guide her path
ignited at the last
the empire of the clouds
just ashes in our past
just ashes at the last
here lie their dreamsas i st and in the sun
on the ground where they built
and the engines did run
to the moon and the stars
now what have we done
oh the dreamers may die
but the dreams live on
dreams live on
dreams live on...
now a shadow on a hill
the angel of the east
the empire of the clouds
may rest in peace
and in a country churchyard
laid head to the mast
eight and forty souls
who came to die in franceCan I play with madness?Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad placeCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeOhhh said that you're too blind to seeI screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for this mischief
Oh in this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said you wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fireCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeListen to me, said the prophetCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeCan I play with madness?Eleven saintly shrouded men
silhouettes stand against the sky
one in front with a cross held high
come to wash my sins awayStanding alone in the wind and rain
feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
nothing to do but await what is coming
Why is then God still protecting me
even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...They'll be saving their prayers when the moment comes
there'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
they'll be coming to claim, take your soul awayThe sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the crossThey'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding comunion so the world be blessed
my creator, my God, lay my soul to restThe sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the crossLost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins awayLife in a city living in L.A.
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy
Rugby and cricket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says "Rodney come home"(chorus)
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheelsA good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in L.A.
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals(repeat chorus)(Rodney's rap)
Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.
When I were a lad, I could lift up five
navies on an end of a shovel.
The reason I never took martial arts because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it.
I was phenomenally strong.
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,
is what makes the world rotate.
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
but I don't live there anymore.
I live in Los Angeles.
It's great!... I thinkRufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born.
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney L.A.(repeat chorus)He's walkin' like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damnedHe's walkin' like a dead man
If he had lived, he would have crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damnedNow it's burnin' his hands, he's turnin' to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screamin' in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're children of the damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the damnedI have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astrayMysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, and I know and I knowI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon meTake my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelI steer between the crashing rocks, sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other wayMysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, and I know and I knowI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon meTake my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelThe freeway is jammed
and it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
'Cause nothing is fair just you look aroundFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
You can live by your witsOnce he built missiles a nations defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal stateFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...The freeway is jammed and its backed up for miles
the car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
Nothing is fair just you look aroundFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fireTears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
flickers above us, to light up the skyUnchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire
Oh no
Oh, yeahOk
Just sixteen, a pick-up truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got no where to call of my ownHit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free yeah
C'mon, I'm running free
I'm running free yeahI'm running free
Spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail

All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the Heavenly, the chosen oneHere the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holdsSeventh son of a seventh son

And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be doneWas many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new worldNight and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no traceStranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men againThey came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no traceWhat became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all aloneStranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from homeWhat became of the man that startedAll are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Stranger in a strange landLand of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from homeI'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friendsFor I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
One last goodbyeThe final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontierIf I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over againFor I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbyeThe final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontierThere isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might findBut I have filled my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbyeThe final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)There's a darkening sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a lost horizon
But no regrets from meMaybe I'll be back some other day
To live again, just who can say?
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for meA hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No one can stop me nowTime is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Some day maybe, I'll wait till thenNo more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more liesNo more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wineTheir time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreamsThere's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is everclear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
Wishing all your life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more liesHoney it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door invite me aroundBring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her goHoney it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soonSo pick up your foolish pride, no going back
No where, no way, no place to hide"We shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France
We shall fight over the seas and oceans.
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
we shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds,
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,
we shall fight on the hills.
We shall never surrender."Have you ever felt
The future is the pastBut you don't know how...?
A reflected dream
Of a captured time
Is it really now, is it really happening?Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your faceSeen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanationHave I found my destination?
I just can't take no moreThe Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
Think I have heard your voice before
Think I have said these words beforeSomething makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanationComing to the realisation
That I can't see for sureI only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myselfI only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myselfThe Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
I get up put on the light
Dreading the oncoming nightScared to fall asleep and dream
The dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compareTo letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting
Saving me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit
Lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence
Lost a nightmare I retrace
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is trueYou walk through the subway
His eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
His blood lust defies all his needsMy innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion
Of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one
I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me
Compelling to satisfy meI can see
What a knife's meant to be
You'll never know
How I came to forsee, see, seeMy faith in believing
Is stronger than lifelines and ties
The glimmer of metal
My moment is ready to strike
The death call arises
A scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow
Remember to walk in the lightI have found you
And now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me
Oh God help me what have I done?
I've done it againYou walk through the subway
My eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
My blood lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out, I'm coming for youYeah it cost me a bundle
Trying to track you down
It's true
Yeah and it's the truth
I'm looking from town to town for you
You know you never offered much security
Do you know I'm gonna get you back?
You just wait and seeI'm never goin' back Juanita
I know you never got my call
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never at allYear I'm spending a long time
Trying to work it out for true
Yeah it's such small crime
Thirsting over you
Living in a Chelsea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know howI'm never goin' back Juanita
I know you never got my call
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never at all(repeat)Yeah I just got to tell you
I'm gonna leave it up to you
Yeah what more can I say?
What more can I do?
Living in a Chelsea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know howI'm never goin' down on Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on Juanita
Never at all
I'm never goin' down on Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on Juanita
Two fingers at all
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never goin' down on you Juanita
I'm never goin' back Juanita ...
(repeat)The words she said turned out why
desperation fills her eyes
Hold her in your arms

Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms

That girl you need
Gonna knock you off your feet
That girl, you know
She'll never let you goCHORUS:

it's been so long, we've missed you,
been searching for honor and glory
out in the dark I have fought for survival
as thunder and gunfire were roaringBack home, the time and the place of
my own my future is calling I know
I do believe there is no other place I can goI must return from my deadly sleep
the only chance I've been given - my destiny
take me home, take me homeBlack as a hole is the soil I was walking
as black as the troops were before me
relentless attack as my eyes started bleeding,
get razed to the ground by the soaringIt's time, you better be leading me home
our future is calling I know
I am the answer to all the remaining unknownI must return from my deadly sleep
the only choice I've been given, - my destiny
take me homeRoaring, embracing the thunder
Twisting and turning around
Locked in I will not go under
Save me before I will drownI must return
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home
Let me go - let me go
Back to my home, back to the people I know
Out in the cold but where can I go I don't know
Where can I go I don't know
Come and take me homeI'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace

But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbyeThe final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art; a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two-faced elite
A menace to society, a social diseaseRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderWatching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or searing at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self-esteem
Pouncing on every word... that you might be sayingRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderSuperficially smiling; a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned
Treachery is plannedRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderWatching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or searing... at life's disarrayWhen every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier liesAnd every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their papers knivesAll in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate itAll in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape itWithout a conscience, they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our mindsThey want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
The rats in the cellar
You know who you are...
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay...From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the westWe have cheated death
And he has cheated usBut that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermoreAnd the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows remain with our hands
Deeper gray, came to mournAll the colors of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?I know what I want
I'll say what I wantAnd no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayI know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayI know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
But the memory still remainsAll the past years not so strange
Our winter times are
Like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not
The only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayCovered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth.
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.You got to watch them â Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven â The thief's in your head.
You've got to watch them â Be quick or be dead

See who pull the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place.The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear.

I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my wayGoin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It' s the real thing girlGot me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like stalkin' aroundGot me feelin' myself and reelin' a
Got me talkin' but nothing's with me and
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' aroundWalkin' through the city lookin' oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my wayGoin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like walkin' aroundThe only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why.
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare.
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the placeRepeatStalks of light grow from the ground
When i cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Leaves of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
Look at love and dream unfolds
Living here you'll never grow oldIf you're looking for something that you can keep
Well baby, pass me by
But if you want something that's twenty years deep
Oh baby, don't even tryBut you want someone to take your soul
Maybe lift you a little bit higher
I've got the fireAah!So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap
'Cause I'm as long as a country-mile
Some like it wide, I like it deep
Well guess which one's my styleYou think you can beat me at my own game
Well babe I say you're a liar
'cause I've got the fire
Yes I haveYou lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day by dayI though I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what my future held that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearnTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnDon't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for meTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnDon't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me
Don't know what I want or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused the more the days go byHere is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothen in white
Stand in the light
Here is the soul of a manTime to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a manWhen the world was virgin
Before the coming of man
Just a solemn witness
The beginning of the endFrom a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And the human raceWe are strange believers
All of us
There are stranger truths
In molten rustWe rise from slumber
It calls our name
Recalls our number
how bad we comeReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failTo God's illusion
Which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fallThe angels come
And angels go
But the lord of light
Shining belowEternal blackness
Beyond the stars
We think our wisdom
Will get that farAt the master's table
The table's bare
No line of plenty
Devastation, despairReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of your time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending your time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failGood day
My name is necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul
And I suck the lives from my bedI own two sons, I gave them breath
And I fill their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgottenFor me, eternity is nothing but a short whileI stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning insideCenturies later I wonder why
What secret they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadelAs we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the crossTemplar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars, to die and be freeThe book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan - his weapon is lust
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of liesThe perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed
Religion's still burning insideTemplar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still running heretics under our skiesAs we kill them all so God know his own
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin
No passover feast for the cursed withinFacing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars and to die and be freeIt's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hallWhere you're going, lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light, this is real
And so you go to warFor the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the sameFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warThere is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender, certain death
You look it in the eyeOn the shores of tyranny
You crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom
With your lonely unmarked gravesFor the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the sameFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warThe keys to death and hell
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will takeQuelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their tollLiberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunTo courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water clean our guilt
With us do what you willThen will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hellNow give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunSOLONow give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunLying awake at night I wipe the sweat
from my brow
But it's not the fear 'cos
I'd rather go nowTrying to visualize the horrors that
will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial groundWhen it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to dieGod let us go now and finish what's
to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done- on EarthTrying to justify to ourselves the
reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgiveBut how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror, corruption must end
And we know, deep down there's
no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snowMother Russia, poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone byMother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your pastMother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger, the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are freethere are times when i wondered
and times when i cried
when my prayers they were answered
at times when i've lied
but if you asked me a question
would i tell you the truth
now there's something to bet on
you've got nothing to losewhen i've sat by the window
and gazed at the rain
with an ache in my heart
but never feeling the pain
if you would tell me
just what my life means
walking in a long road
never reaching the endgod give me the answers to my life
god give me the answers to my dreams
god give me the answers to my prayers
god give me the answers to my beingRemember that song called 'Kill Me'
From Vick Timm's last LP
Too much of a risk for a golden disc
The price he paid for moneyCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll starSing your song, you can't go wrong
Attempted his business adviser
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniperCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll starThe news is read, the meaning spread
One yawn, two yawn and back to bed
Turn off the light and hold me tight
Come on maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, 'Fini Belle Vie', bonne nuitRemember that song called 'Kill Me'
A lecture on political chicanery
Of people's rape, recorded on tape
Bought shame to the presidencyTonight, tonight, one more point for human right
Tonight, tonight, one more point for human rightRemember that song 'Kill Me'
Once used by a man from Galilee
He had nothin' to lose, he was king of the Jews
Secured his place in historyCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateurThe news is read, the voice is spread
One yawn, two yawn and back to bed
Turn off the light and hold me tight
Come on maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, 'Fini Belle Vie'Vick played the part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When howling lead, bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rockA new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock[Instrumental]One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor bladeTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me, noOne night of magic rush
The start: a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in loveTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me, ohTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meAnd you
You knew the hand of the devil
And you
Kept us awake with wolves' teeth
Sharing different heartbeats in one nightTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meTo call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for meI'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by to see him again
And when you two danced
oh what a dance
And when you two laughed
oh what a laugh
Has he mentioned my age, love?Or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair
I'm in love with your brother
I'd thought I'd come byI'm in love with your brother
Yes, I am but maybe I
shouldn't ask for his name
and you danced
oh what a dance
and you laughed
oh what a laugh
Does he know what I do andYou pass this on, won't you and
If I asked him once what would he say
Is he willing, can he play?
I wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor and
does he know what I do and
you pass this on, won't you and?I wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor
And if I asked him once what would he say?

You pass this on, won't you and
I wasn't really looking for some more than some company on the dancefloor and...I cut your nails and comb your hair
I carry you down the stairs
I wanted to see right through from the other side
I wanted to walk a trail with no end in sightThe moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love it's easy to forget
When we are all alone then we do both agree
We have a thing in common this was meant to beYou close my eyes and soothe my ears
You heal my wounds and dry my tears
On the inside of this marble house I grow
And the seeds I sow will grow up prisoners tooThe moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love it's easy to forget
When we are all alone then we do both agree
We have a thing in common this was meant to beNow where's your shoulder
What is its name
What's your scent
Say it againIf it goes faster can you still follow me
It must be safe when it's on TVI raise my hands to heaven for curiosity
I don't know what to ask for
What has it got for me
The others say we're hiding
It's as forward as can be
Some things I do for money
Some things I do for freeFuu!
I got to got to let you down
But in an hour I will change my mind.

To the endRumous telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.If we say that there is something above the mountains
if we say that there is something we can't see.
Promise you will never believe me
cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easyAnd you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.Everybody was laughing when they found us
one for you and one for me.
Then they let us go to hunt us down again
and still you refuse to see
why everything has to stay uglyRumous telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.We were looking for a room
We were looking for a hotel
We were in between
We were a few chosen
Somewhere to fit in
Something that's fitting
After one day it started itching
And we rubbed until it was bleedingAnd we ran through the moonlight far beyond
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyondWe were looking for something to blow up
We were looking for someone to follow
We had one way out
We had some hours left
We were so close
We knew we were chosen
We aimed for high speed
And for someone who could catch meAnd we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyondWe were looking for a room
We were looking for something to blow up
We knew we were chosen
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond
And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyondEyes are sober and this is the plan
I'm sitting in a car heading Neverland
A fancy man a fancy man
He's pointing with the fingers that are left on his handEyes are hazel but far too cold
Looking out for love
But none of us can
Where's the monkey that I've been told of
I'm staring at the money
That burns in my hand
I'm dancing for dollars
And for a fancy manCome right over
I'll knock on your shoulder
This is a story and this is what I've planned
An angry man an angry man
Nothing is more fatal than an angry manVulnerable heights
Feed the hand that bites me
Following the steam into another room
Standing in the corner
Is this my home
Showing us love that none of us can
I'm singing for money
That burns in my handTell me
Will I make it home tonightI'm doing it for dollars and for a fancy man
I've got a lot of money that burns in my handI am a cop, shut up
I piss in your mouthI am a cop, shut up
I shoot you in the face motherfucker
I piss in your mouthI am a cop, shut up
I shoot you right on the spot
You motherfucking shitThe doctor came in the morning
She held my hand
And asked "was it worth it?"
"Could it be worse than this?"
Please recall
Give me a hint
Anything will do
If this was the last time now you should tell us what to doI was afraid I guess
Now I can't think no more
I was so concentrated
On keeping things together
I've learned to focus on
I didn't want to disappoint
Now where is everybody
Is it still light outside?No more tears and you'll be fine
I stay here all night
And when I've stayed all night
We go out in the morning lightAnd then you try to live the day
I don't know how, but I know what to say
Is it medicine or social skill
Don't have the answer and nobody will
You go screaming on without a word
Being sad is a fulltime work
And now the day has come to an end
And then you start to cry againIs it medicine?
Is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
Is it medicine, is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?I never knew this could happen to me
I know now fragility
I know there's people who I haven't told
I know of people who are getting oldWish I could speak in just one sweep
What you are and what you mean to me
Instead I mumble randomly
You stand by and enlighten meIn a dream I lost my teeth again
Calling me woman and half man
Yes in a dream all my teeth fell out
A cracked smile and a silent shout
A cracked smile and a silent shoutIf I explain it once thoroughly
He'll have you later 'cause it's never free
You were at the gigantic spree
I caught a glimpse now it haunts me
I caught a glimpse now it haunts meSharpen my body like a pen
Come on I need to show it
Something too small for a lense
If I rub it, if I wipe itGuiding with one single hand
Nothing's wrong, you like the feeling
I am all over the land
Come on, I need to show itBack on the mountain again
I was standing watching seasons
You're now my only friend
I'm too heavy, I'm the burdenSitting and picking on myself
It's a shiny, shiny morning
And when the light finds my eye
I'll be fleeting like a scentI hold my breath and then count to three
On and on, outworn
Must be five hundred degrees
Can't sail on, outwornI hold my breath and then count to three
On and on, outworn
Must be five hundred degrees
Will it show, in my showWho's wrong but fair?
Who's wrong but fair?
As I move down the street
As I walk block block
As I move down the street
As I walk block block
Use all of me (x10)
Oh
Oh move
Stay out here
Stay out here
Is this happening?
They make it worthless, it will be
It's now when they dance
Just so, just now, the euro falls
Our short century
Time Square
I know the last
You and me
Are you on your way?
Just so just how I hear a call
Our short century
You have the most I wait to engrave
You've put my foot in front of the other
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
One foot yours on mine
Stay out here
Stay out here
Is this happening?
That breaks my band, what's left for us all?
You stand down, pinball
And this time, this time this time time
What is remember?
We hate too much
How to stay in doubt
You have the most beautiful way
Of putting one foot in front of the other
You know that sometimes it's from the fall
Those things we love are open indeed
Stay out here
Stay out here
You sure will love me
Most things we love are open in this
They are here
We're more friendly
Lose your way, your way
Lose your way, your way
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Put one foot in front of the other
Most things you love are open in this
They are here
We're more friendly
Use all of me
Use all of me
As I move down the street
As I move down the street
As I walk blop blop
As I walk blop blop
As I make shape of it so long
Just won't go back
Walk walk walk
Blop blop blopI keep my dick hangin' out of my pants

I was chosen by standard procedures
and I'll assure you I don't mind.I'm the head over small buissness
employing old male friends of my kind.

nÃ¤e, vi stoppar dÃ¤r.A handful of elf pee
That's my soul
spray it all over
fill the bowl
legs astride
an axe to grind
generous actions with the speed of lightWithout you my life would be boringUnder the iceberg
there's a tomb
working the way up
Picking a hole in the cocoon
A bucket of tiger pee
come with me
bottoms up
reaching a dreamWithout you my life would be boringWhat if we can't make it but we say that we can
Shaking the habitual
relate it to time
we're laughing at the future and we cry 'bout the past
I'm holding on forever but how long will forever last?Without you my life would be boringThe piss is territorialWhat if we can't make it but we say that we can
Shaking the habitual
relate it to time
we're laughing at the future and we cry 'bout the past
I'm holding on forever but how long will forever last?Without you my life would be boringIn the middle of nowhere
when we're looking for something
then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a wonderer
and I welcomed the dew as much as you didWhen we're looking for brushwood
in the nearest neighbourhood
then we follow the sky with the eye
we search vegetation
and surprised by the rain
we're stumbling, tripping home againIn the middle of nowhere
when we're looking for something
then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a walker
and I welcomed the dew as much as you didWe found the little man
and his aeroplane
but we never located the animal
Examined the dirty ground
like it never been done
Modern exploring of 1991Coming home after a long long walk
Coming home after a dozen of walks
Coming home after a long long war
Coming home after a dozen of warsWe are out of wind
We have pock-marked chin
We have lots of water
We turn the other cheek and we winOne thousand stories and there's always more
We've been offered one more lap to go
In my hand I hold a key
It's dear to me cause I know where it leadsWe are out of wind
We have pock-marked chin
We have all this water
We turn the other cheek and we grinHear my troubles of mine
Can you take me for one last ride
I want to bend my soul again
That's what we do when we get older
Where's your troubled mind
You've got your money and you got them 'cause others just can't
There's the lottery
About geographyDon't know the hand you're holding
Paying someone to put them to bed againAnd that's when it hurts
The difference
This is hot blood
And a difference
What a difference
A little difference would makeHear my love sigh
I've got a story that money just can't buy
Western standards
Poverty's profitable
See it slip and slide
not just one answer 'cause it's working like parallel lines
It's not that easy
When you want it easyAnd that's when it hurts
When you see the difference
It's a raging lung
And a difference
What a difference
A little difference would makeDon't leave me now
Don't fall asleep
We need to rest sometimes
but don't take long
It's something in system
that still circulates
We'll dig a hole in the backyard
and drain the bloodWe came down from the north
Blue hands and a torch
Red wine and food for free
A possibility
We share our mothers' health
It is what we've been dealt
What's in it for me
Fine, then I'll agreeTrees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always nearTrees there will be
Apples, fruits maybe
You know what I fear
The end is always nearSay you like it
Say you need it

I am afraid of everything
When you told me I was special
It was the happiest moment for a long long timeListen now
I keep forgetting your name
When you laid down on the kitchen floor
It was the happiest moment for a long long timeWe seek new seed now
Some revolutionary
and you will never get a hold
We seek and we will find
reason to stay alive
The price has never been this lowListen now
I was afraid of everything
Then I straightened my head up
It was the happiest moment for a long long timeWe seek new seed now
Some revolutionary
and you will never get a hold
We seek and we will find
reason to stay alive
The price has never been this lowStrawberry and long cherry on top
Barbury, popcorn slur, can count
Coffee and the curse and racing team
The horrible cross of an evening queenIf I was a bird
I would fly high over the world
Come home at night to your garden
build a nest among the branches
and I'll comb your hair with my beakIf I was a bird
I would count my time in pearls
Under my wings you'll find shelter
you'll breed bugs and keep me well fed
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to flyBut you wanted me to be a girl
without feathers without urge
then my wings quick dissappeared
and left was only fear
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to flyproclaim the reason why I'll have to fly
I'll have to flyBut you wanted me to be a girl
without feathers without urge
then my wings quick dissappeared
and left was only fear
and I proclaim the reason why I'll have to flyproclaim the reason why I'll have to fly
I'll have to flyI've got a new story now and it goes like this
I took my hand out of my pocket up came a fist
It was headline news
One more abuse
I've got to tell it with a fist
And it goes like thisHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhSo where's the femininity
The one with skirts and high heels
A shiny sink and home made meals
The one and only way
If you enter you'll stay
Sons and daughters you will breed
As long as you breastfeed
Yeah being a man is a bliss
One Hit one KissHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhThen the lights came on, it was all a scene
Bend back, give head it's not pornography
If you do it with lights then it's art you see
If you do it with a twist
Yes, artisticallyHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhI could do the laundry
The women's work
For a reasonable salary I would wash the world
It wouldn't affect my libido or my self esteem
Don't need to mark my territory
It's all obvious to me
It's manhood's bliss
One Hit one Kiss
Spending time with my family
Like the CorleonesHo ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huhSomething's got a hold of my head
And it won't leave me alone
Neon when you come onSomething's got a hold of my head

Drifting further, every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one elseI have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me freeThings not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feelEmptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness, taking dawn
I was me, but now he's goneNo one but me
Can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Bye...I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops meNow that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meBack in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll liveFed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meNow the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help meDarkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellEnd of passion play, crumbling away

You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage

I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey (hey)
I'm your life
And I no longer careI'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but trueI'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reason, alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm youSad but trueHow could he know this new dawn's light, would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure
Was he the one, causing pain, With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid, Of the things he's feeling
He
could
just
be
gone
He
would justsail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive.
And how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog, It's thick and suffocatingHis seeking life outside its hell, Inside intoxicatingHe's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
...a...
castaway
They've
all goneaway
They've gone awayHow can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?, When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive meForgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me notForgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light, Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally derangedDream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarredSleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rageSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me aloneBuild my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insaneThey think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hellSanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, (just leave me alone)
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out againBorn to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the groundMouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waitingWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comesPush you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your timeGod, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grayWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comesLove is a four-letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four-letter word
Here in this prisonI suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swearMake his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men on five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely knowFor whom the bell tolls
Time marches onFor whom the bell tollsTake a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsAnd the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I craveOnly knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you willBut I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhereAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
And the earth becomes my throne
And the earth becomes my throneI adapt to the unknown, under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone, I ask no oneAnd my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain, off the beaten path I reign

Call me what you will, But I'll take my time anywhereI'm free to speak my mind anywhere

Told me when i was young
"son your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what i heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But i must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Yeah still
Rebel mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what i heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now i'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all i see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Let this heart be stillOn a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was throughHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The PageSo you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your standHere I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The PageWhoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
YeahHere I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you knowThere's a feeling, deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling, of a hammerhead
You need it oh so badAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really soreIn a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonightAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nearsNow's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we chooseAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacHere we go!(1st solo)Whiplash!(2nd solo)
The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
We'll never stop, we'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidityOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own wayRape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sightOut for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own wayThe window burns to light the way back homeA light that warms, no matter where they've goneThey're off to find the hero of the dayBut what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?Still the window burns, time so slowly turnsSomeone there is sighingKeepers of the flames
Do you feel your names?Can't you hear your babies crying?(Mama, they try and break me)(Still they try and break me)'scuse me while I tend to how I feelThese things return to me that still seem realNow deservingly this easy chairBut the rocking stops by wheels of despairDon't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feelNo I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feelBut now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's lightSo can't you hear your babies crying now?Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams that
ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, the tryBy the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and dieIn the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation

On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer

To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...Don't tread on meLove it or leave it, she with the deadly bite

Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilanceWoo, no, no, no...So don't tread on meSo be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

Don't tread on me(instrumental)(instrumental)My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, Oh the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the wordMoving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friendFreedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside
To each his ownDo you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lieDoesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayIndependence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
(Bridge and solo)
Do you know what I know?Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thingI hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayMy life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fateI give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto meHarvester of sorrow
Language of the madHarvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to meGet back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of painYour loss becomes my gain
Anger, miseryYou'll suffer unto me

What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call lifeDear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspiredInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindlyDear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chanceDear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say not as I doInnocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly
I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue meDear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knewSpineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You willTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahMarvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We seeTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
and you'll get a better seatBow to Leper MessiahWitchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you followTime for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seatLie

Break the ice, I can't take anymoreFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under iceCrystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I sayFreezing

I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified

Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
It's never as sweet as it seemsLike a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to biteLike a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like Conviction
A Premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny
I denyI blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to dieLike a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a General
Without a mission
Until the war will start again... start again.I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your lifeLike a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your kneesAlmost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your lifeBodies fill the fields I see
Hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
No one to pretend
Running blind through killing fieldsBred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to careDo just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine gun fireDoes nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
Get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear
Glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clayNow an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take awayBack to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must dieBack to the frontYou coward
You servant
You blind man
Why, am I dying?Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
(Solo)
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lyingHell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth
Nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
Molded day by day
Looking back I realizeNothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Back to the frontIced Honey LyricsYou can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honeyNow me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honeyIf I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honeyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lambIf it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so longIf your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a startAnd me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boyIf you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticksNo matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honeyGirl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now

You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at nightYou Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got MeI am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's darkFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that somethings watching youFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always thereHave you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone thereFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the darkWatching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behindFear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks aloneYou'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning backThe bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death, oh, ohThe horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fallWe hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day, oh, ohWe get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan, oh, ohI'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running lowRunning lowWhen the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for meCan it be that there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly awayMark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truthWhen you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusionYeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy nameWhite man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains, we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, a stab in the back
Women and children and cowards attack
Run to the hillsRun for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their goldEnslaving the young and destroying the oldRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesRun to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your livesWe shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France.
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beaches.
We shall fight on the landing grounds.
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
We shall fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender!Won't you come into my room?

Iron Maiden wants you for deadFrom the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travelin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone elseI close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night, ain't it funny how it is
You never miss if til' it's gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be til' my dying daySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsToo much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily, when you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my hands up to the skySo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsSo understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make this stand
And realize you're living in the golden yearsThere goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too lateRunning, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing againBandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving (doing it again)
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding
Reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty sixI left alone,
my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mindWhat did I see?
Can I believe
that what I saw That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I sawin my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
'Cause in my dreams
it's always thereThe evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despairNight was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?6
66
the number of the beast
Hell and fire
was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
6
6
6
the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize
can't avoid their eyes

the one for you and me
I'm coming back
I will return
And I'll possess your body
and I'll make you burn
I have the fire
I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its courseInto the Abyss I'll fall- the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night- watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows- in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a God-
And He will die too.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned-
Marbled in stone.
A shell of a man God preserved-
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from my grave.Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...Are you a man of peace
Or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you
Don't know which anymoreSo many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe againA life that's made to breath
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption
Bad or good intentA wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winnerThey fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would knowAnd as He lies in Heaven
Or it could be in Hell
I feel He's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't knowPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isMore pain and misery
In the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blindIt brings upon us more
A famine, death and war
You know religion has
A lot to answer forPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life isAnd as they search to find
The bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are
Scattered across the landAnd as the spirits seem
To whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere
Another war beginsAnd all because of it
You'd think that we would learn
But still the body count
The city fires burnSomewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying
Stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me whyPlease tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what ware is

He fell upon the Cross
To die for all of those
Who never mourn His lossIt wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why, tell me whyWake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a raceThat is part of a clan
And to live on Highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so cleanWhen alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be freeIs it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking whyCan't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the ClansNot alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a ClansmanFreedom, freedom
Freedom, freedomIt's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
Ancestors could hear
What is happening nowThey would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has written in chainsAnd I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the ClansmanAnd I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken aliveAnd I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born freeAnd I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want

But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Some blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living deathThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast... YEAH!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babiesThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the wombThe body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gunThe killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all nightMidnight... All night!Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.The albatross begins with it's vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me."Day after day, day after day,
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
All the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
BUt how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?See... onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.Death and she Life in Death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one."One after one by the star dogged moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one."The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyesAnd revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feetGoing all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight, to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, haha, now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going out
If you kill me, it's self defense
If I kill you then I call it vengeanceSpit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight, to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don'tBreak the walls I'm coming out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own nowDon't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want toYou'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cos I'll run rings around you

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now

'Cos I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm goingLove is a razor and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocenceAnd I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now...

...Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I've never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death
Has come for me?
I can't believe, that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

(Solo)
My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait,

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to tear my body apart
Livin' lovin' I'm on the runSo far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
But she's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy
Doctor doctor, pleaseDon't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Oooh! I'm on the runMaybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Sunrise to sunsetDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
by the tides of timeSpend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsDream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of timeSands are flowing and the lines
are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the
desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nightsAs the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the stillHis eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gazeFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun, yeah, mmmNow the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God my father, I fly!"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dreamNow he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his graveFly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun(Solo)Yeah, fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly(Solo)Fly as high as the sunLet me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of things that I saw.
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more.
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars.
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move.
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees.
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace.
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead.
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led.
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go.
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals.
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me.
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me.
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes.
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of themThey had ascended from hell.
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me.
Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead.
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me.
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me.
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me.
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled.
I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance.
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead.
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it.
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go.
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead.Hand of fate is moving
And the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet
And so what are you gonna doYour tongue has frozen now
You've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn
Is calling you his wayYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breathYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeThe ferryman wants his money
You ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat
As you set up off the trackNothing you can contemplate
Will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark
Sets the universe aflameYou watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up againYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeYour time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will comeuooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo - uooo
uooo - uooo - uooo
uoooO God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
But take away our pride.Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this.
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain.
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know.
The Secret of the HangmanThe smile on his lips.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips.
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry.
So we lay in a black embrace
And the Seed is sown in a holy placeAnd I watched and I waited for the Dawn.
The light of the Blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are openingYou'll see.
Bind us all together
Ablaze with Hope and Free.
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain.
For the one who will be King
Is the watcher in the Ring.
It is You.C'mon yeahI've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my graspYou've been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false maskAnd you know and I know that
You ain't got long now to lastYour looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your pastYou're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fallKnowing the terror and holding
You have on us allYeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maulYou know I'm helpless
From your mesmerizing cat callUhKeep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray
Don't fade awayWatch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray
From the narrow wayUh, uhh
I'm running and hiding in my dreams
You're always thereYou're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scareYou damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the airYou haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lairFeel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyesI wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength, an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymoreThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingJust by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through you mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demiseThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dyingThere's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
And be reborn again?All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemedBut never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despiseThe false smile maketh of the manGlass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truthThere's something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling downTears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drownedTears of a clownWho motivates the motivatorFacade it has to go
He knows it sooner or laterSmile for cameras all okBut tomorrow is another day he must get throughHe had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the bestLay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clownTomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown."My son ask for thyself another
Kingdom, for that which I leaveis too small for thee"
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)
Near to the east
In a part of ancient GreeceIn an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was AlexanderAt the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian SeaIn 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of menAlexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled PersiaThe Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris riverHe met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he foundTook Persepolis the capital of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the GreatBecame a God amongst mortal menA Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of AsiaHelonism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in BabylonAnd if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of meJust for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening againWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersAnd as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnedWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersThere are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the badWill we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own handWe're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothersWhen you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of lifeDying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back homeWilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldA brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new worldDying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back homeIt's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky.The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow.Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb.They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest.
They dared to go where no one would to try
They chose to fly where eagles dareWhen I stand before you shining
In the early morning Sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've doneOh the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the
Towns become the ghosts of timeOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged soulsWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayCurving on the edge of daylight
'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
'til the Sun is born againStretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
Speck of dust in cosmic sandOver borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners stormy gravesWe will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birthTo Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayTo Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
Coming home far away
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayIn a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of PaschendaleRelive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his yearsLaying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends againIn the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us allWhistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soonMany soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to beginHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againThe bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we goCrucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seenSwear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of PaschendaleCruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry stillI stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we goBlood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on PaschendaleDodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of deathAs we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throatHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againHome, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live againSee my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at PaschendaleBorn into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to beNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
Going to find my man

Yeah I'm a wrathchild
Hello wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeahSome say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find
Some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazyNow I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel 'round'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeah
YeahIf you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia AvenueMeet a lady that I know, so if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for, everybody's got their viceIf you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it freeSo any time you're down the East End, don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can knowCharlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting diseaseSome day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightCharlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonightBeat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with meInfinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins againSomeone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end?
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
Getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deepEven though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? Well me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?Help me, help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing myself even within my dreamsThere's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again, and again, and again, and again...Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard? Have you heard?He sees them in the distance, when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know? Did you know?As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHave you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?
Have you heard? Have you heard?There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it it will never be the same
Did you know? Did you know?He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never knowThey tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know? Did you know?He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blowsHe sees the picture on the wall it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying GraceRemember times they had they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be goneThey've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will comeThey make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and waitCan't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begunCan't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
When they found them had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blowsto ride the storm to an empire of the cloudsto ride the storm they climbed
aboard their silver ghost
to ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
to ride the storm and damn the rest... oblivion
royalty and dignitaries brandy and cigars
grey lady giant of the skies
you hold them in your arms
the millionth chance they laughed
to take down his majesty's craft
to india they say magic carpet float away
an october fateful day...
mist is in the treesstone sweats with the dew
the morning sunrise red before the blue
hanging at the mast
waiting for command
his majesty's airship
the r101
she's the biggest vessel built by mana giant of the skies
for all you unbelievers
the titanic fits inside
drum roll tight her canvas skin
silvered in the sun
never tested with the fury
with the beating yet to come
the fury yet t o come
in the gathering gloomthe storm rising in the west
the coxswain stared
into the plunging wea therglass
we must go nowwe must take our chance with fate
we must go now
for a politician, he can't be late
the airship crew a wake for thirtyhours at full stretch
but the ship is in their backbone
every sinew every inch
she never flew at full speed
a trial never done
her fragile outer co ver
her achilles would become
an achilles yet t o come
sailors of the skya hardened breed
loyal to the king and an airship creed
the engines drum
the telegraph sounds
release the cords
that bind us to the ground
said the coxswain "sir she's heavy"
"she'll never make this flight"
said the captain "damn the cargo"
"we'll be on our way tonight"
groundlings cheered in wonder
as she backed off from the mast
baptizing them her water
from the ballast fore and aft
now she slips into our past
fighting the wind as it rolls youfeeling the diesels that push you along
watching the channel below you
lower and lower into the night
lights are passing below you
northern france asleep in their beds
storm is ra ging around you
a million to one that's what he said
reaper standing beside herwith his scythe cuts to the bone
panic to make a decision
experienced men asleep in their graves
her cover is ripped and she's drowning
rain is fl ooding into the hull
bleeding to death and she's falling
lifting gas is draining away
"we're down lads" came the crybow plunging from the sky
three thousand horses silent
as the ship began to die
the flares t o guide her path
ignited at the last
the empire of the clouds
just ashes in our past
just ashes at the last
here lie their dreamsas i st and in the sun
on the ground where they built
and the engines did run
to the moon and the stars
now what have we done
oh the dreamers may die
but the dreams live on
dreams live on
dreams live on...
now a shadow on a hill
the angel of the east
the empire of the clouds
may rest in peace
and in a country churchyard
laid head to the mast
eight and forty souls
who came to die in franceCan I play with madness?Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad placeCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeOhhh said that you're too blind to seeI screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for this mischief
Oh in this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said you wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fireCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeListen to me, said the prophetCan I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to seeCan I play with madness?Eleven saintly shrouded men
silhouettes stand against the sky
one in front with a cross held high
come to wash my sins awayStanding alone in the wind and rain
feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
nothing to do but await what is coming
Why is then God still protecting me
even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...They'll be saving their prayers when the moment comes
there'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
they'll be coming to claim, take your soul awayThe sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the crossThey'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding comunion so the world be blessed
my creator, my God, lay my soul to restThe sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the crossLost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins awayLife in a city living in L.A.
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy
Rugby and cricket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says "Rodney come home"(chorus)
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheelsA good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in L.A.
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals(repeat chorus)(Rodney's rap)
Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.
When I were a lad, I could lift up five
navies on an end of a shovel.
The reason I never took martial arts because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it.
I was phenomenally strong.
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,
is what makes the world rotate.
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
but I don't live there anymore.
I live in Los Angeles.
It's great!... I thinkRufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born.
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney L.A.(repeat chorus)He's walkin' like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damnedHe's walkin' like a dead man
If he had lived, he would have crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damnedNow it's burnin' his hands, he's turnin' to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screamin' in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're children of the damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the damnedI have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astrayMysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, and I know and I knowI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon meTake my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelI steer between the crashing rocks, sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other wayMysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, and I know and I knowI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon meTake my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelI see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son, chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so, nothings real until you feelThe freeway is jammed
and it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
'Cause nothing is fair just you look aroundFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
You can live by your witsOnce he built missiles a nations defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal stateFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...The freeway is jammed and its backed up for miles
the car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
Nothing is fair just you look aroundFalling down
Falling down
Falling down...
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fireTears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
flickers above us, to light up the skyUnchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows, tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire
Oh no
Oh, yeahOk
Just sixteen, a pick-up truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got no where to call of my ownHit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free yeah
C'mon, I'm running free
I'm running free yeahI'm running free
Spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on meRunning wild, running free, yeah

All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the Heavenly, the chosen oneHere the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holdsSeventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be doneWas many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new worldNight and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no traceStranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men againThey came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no traceWhat became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all aloneStranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from homeWhat became of the man that startedAll are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Stranger in a strange landLand of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from homeI'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friendsFor I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
One last goodbyeThe final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontierIf I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over againFor I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbyeThe final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontierThere isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might findBut I have filled my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbyeThe final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)There's a darkening sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a lost horizon
But no regrets from meMaybe I'll be back some other day
To live again, just who can say?
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for meA hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No one can stop me nowTime is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Some day maybe, I'll wait till thenNo more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more liesNo more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wineTheir time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreamsThere's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is everclear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
Wishing all your life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies, no more lies
No more liesHoney it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door invite me aroundBring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her goHoney it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soonSo pick up your foolish pride, no going back
No where, no way, no place to hide"We shall go on to the end.
We shall fight in France
We shall fight over the seas and oceans.
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be
we shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds,
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,
we shall fight on the hills.
We shall never surrender."Have you ever felt
The future is the pastBut you don't know how...?
A reflected dream
Of a captured time
Is it really now, is it really happening?Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your faceSeen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanationHave I found my destination?
I just can't take no moreThe Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
Think I have heard your voice before
Think I have said these words beforeSomething makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanationComing to the realisation
That I can't see for sureI only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myselfI only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myselfThe Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
I get up put on the light
Dreading the oncoming nightScared to fall asleep and dream
The dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compareTo letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting
Saving me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit
Lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence
Lost a nightmare I retrace
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
The Dream is true, The Dream is true
The Dream is true, The Dream is trueYou walk through the subway
His eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
His blood lust defies all his needsMy innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion
Of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one
I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me
Compelling to satisfy meI can see
What a knife's meant to be
You'll never know
How I came to forsee, see, seeMy faith in believing
Is stronger than lifelines and ties
The glimmer of metal
My moment is ready to strike
The death call arises
A scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow
Remember to walk in the lightI have found you
And now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me
Oh God help me what have I done?
I've done it againYou walk through the subway
My eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
My blood lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out, I'm coming for youYeah it cost me a bundle
Trying to track you down
It's true
Yeah and it's the truth
I'm looking from town to town for you
You know you never offered much security
Do you know I'm gonna get you back?
You just wait and seeI'm never goin' back Juanita
I know you never got my call
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never at allYear I'm spending a long time
Trying to work it out for true
Yeah it's such small crime
Thirsting over you
Living in a Chelsea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know howI'm never goin' back Juanita
I know you never got my call
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never at all(repeat)Yeah I just got to tell you
I'm gonna leave it up to you
Yeah what more can I say?
What more can I do?
Living in a Chelsea flat
Seems so lonely now
I just know I gotta get you back
I just don't know howI'm never goin' down on Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on Juanita
Never at all
I'm never goin' down on Juanita
Never gonna make that call
Never goin' down on Juanita
Two fingers at all
I'm never goin' back Juanita
Never goin' down on you Juanita
I'm never goin' back Juanita ...

desperation fills her eyes
Hold her in your arms

Fight and win, never give in
Hold her in your arms

Gonna knock you off your feet

it's been so long, we've missed you,
been searching for honor and glory
out in the dark I have fought for survival
as thunder and gunfire were roaringBack home, the time and the place of
my own my future is calling I know
I do believe there is no other place I can goI must return from my deadly sleep
the only chance I've been given - my destiny
take me home, take me homeBlack as a hole is the soil I was walking
as black as the troops were before me
relentless attack as my eyes started bleeding,
get razed to the ground by the soaringIt's time, you better be leading me home
our future is calling I know
I am the answer to all the remaining unknownI must return from my deadly sleep
the only choice I've been given, - my destiny

Twisting and turning around
Locked in I will not go under
Save me before I will drownI must return
Take me home - take me home
Take me home - take me home

Let me go - let me go
Back to my home, back to the people I know
Out in the cold but where can I go I don't know
Where can I go I don't know

That one last goodbyeThe final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art; a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two-faced elite
A menace to society, a social diseaseRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderWatching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or searing at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self-esteem
Pouncing on every word... that you might be sayingRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderSuperficially smiling; a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned
Treachery is plannedRape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy, one-upmanship orderWatching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or searing... at life's disarrayWhen every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier liesAnd every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their papers knivesAll in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate itAll in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape itWithout a conscience, they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our mindsThey want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
The rats in the cellar
You know who you are...
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay...From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the westWe have cheated death
And he has cheated usBut that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream for evermoreAnd the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows remain with our hands
Deeper gray, came to mournAll the colors of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?I know what I want
I'll say what I wantAnd no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayI know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayI know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
But the memory still remainsAll the past years not so strange
Our winter times are
Like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not
The only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then the journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it awayCovered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth.
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.You got to watch them â Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven â The thief's in your head.
You've got to watch them â Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven â The thief in your head.Be quick or be dead â Be quick (quick, quick) or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
See...what's ruling all our lives
See...who's pulling strings
See...what's ruling all our lives
See who pull the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place.The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear.
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself, stupid, rob yourself blind.You got to watch them â Be quick or be dead

Be quick or be dead â Be quick!Walkin' through the city lookin' oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my wayGoin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It' s the real thing girlGot me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like stalkin' aroundGot me feelin' myself and reelin' a
Got me talkin' but nothing's with me and
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' aroundWalkin' through the city lookin' oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my wayGoin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like walkin' aroundThe only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why.
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare.
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the placeRepeatStalks of light grow from the ground
When i cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Leaves of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
Look at love and dream unfolds
Living here you'll never grow oldIf you're looking for something that you can keep
Well baby, pass me by
But if you want something that's twenty years deep
Oh baby, don't even tryBut you want someone to take your soul
Maybe lift you a little bit higher
I've got the fireAah!So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap
'Cause I'm as long as a country-mile
Some like it wide, I like it deep
Well guess which one's my styleYou think you can beat me at my own game
Well babe I say you're a liar
'cause I've got the fire
Yes I haveYou lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day by dayI though I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what my future held that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearnTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnDon't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for meTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnTell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learnDon't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me
Don't know what I want or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused the more the days go byHere is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothen in white
Stand in the light
Here is the soul of a manTime to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a manWhen the world was virgin
Before the coming of man
Just a solemn witness
The beginning of the endFrom a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And the human raceWe are strange believers
All of us
There are stranger truths
In molten rustWe rise from slumber
It calls our name
Recalls our number
how bad we comeReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failTo God's illusion
Which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fallThe angels come
And angels go
But the lord of light
Shining belowEternal blackness
Beyond the stars
We think our wisdom
Will get that farAt the master's table
The table's bare
No line of plenty
Devastation, despairReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of your time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending your time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failReefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should failGood day
My name is necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul
And I suck the lives from my bedI own two sons, I gave them breath
And I fill their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgottenFor me, eternity is nothing but a short whileI stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning insideCenturies later I wonder why
What secret they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of MontsÃ©gur
Blood on the stones of the citadelAs we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the crossTemplar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars, to die and be freeThe book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan - his weapon is lust
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of liesThe perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed
Religion's still burning insideTemplar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still running heretics under our skiesAs we kill them all so God know his own
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin
No passover feast for the cursed withinFacing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars and to die and be freeIt's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hallWhere you're going, lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light, this is real
And so you go to warFor the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the sameFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warThere is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender, certain death
You look it in the eyeOn the shores of tyranny
You crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom
With your lonely unmarked gravesFor the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the sameFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warFar away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold, bloody war
These colours don't run from cold, bloody warThe keys to death and hell
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will takeQuelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their tollLiberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunTo courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water clean our guilt
With us do what you willThen will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hellNow give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunSOLONow give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hellSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunSpirit holy life eternal
Raise me up take me home
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset
Onward journey begunLying awake at night I wipe the sweat
from my brow
But it's not the fear 'cos
I'd rather go nowTrying to visualize the horrors that
will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial groundWhen it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to dieGod let us go now and finish what's
to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done- on EarthTrying to justify to ourselves the
reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgiveBut how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror, corruption must end
And we know, deep down there's
no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snowMother Russia, poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone byMother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your pastMother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger, the grief
Can you be happy
Now your people are freethere are times when i wondered
and times when i cried
when my prayers they were answered
at times when i've lied
but if you asked me a question
would i tell you the truth
now there's something to bet on
you've got nothing to losewhen i've sat by the window
and gazed at the rain
with an ache in my heart
but never feeling the pain
if you would tell me
just what my life means
walking in a long road
never reaching the endgod give me the answers to my life
god give me the answers to my dreams
god give me the answers to my prayers
god give me the answers to my beingRemember that song called 'Kill Me'
From Vick Timm's last LP
Too much of a risk for a golden disc
The price he paid for moneyCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll starSing your song, you can't go wrong
Attempted his business adviser
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniperCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll star
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock n' roll starThe news is read, the meaning spread
One yawn, two yawn and back to bed
Turn off the light and hold me tight
Come on maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, 'Fini Belle Vie', bonne nuitRemember that song called 'Kill Me'
A lecture on political chicanery
Of people's rape, recorded on tape
Bought shame to the presidencyTonight, tonight, one more point for human right
Tonight, tonight, one more point for human rightRemember that song 'Kill Me'
Once used by a man from Galilee
He had nothin' to lose, he was king of the Jews
Secured his place in historyCe soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateurThe news is read, the voice is spread
One yawn, two yawn and back to bed
Turn off the light and hold me tight
Come on maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song, 'Fini Belle Vie'Vick played the part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When howling lead, bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rockA new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock[Instrumental]I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na naCigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na naDrunk in love, I want youWe woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all nightLast thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the clubDrunk in love
We be all night, love, loveWe be all night, love, love
We be all night
And everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking
Park it in my lot 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy toys
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice hoarseThen I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that woodI'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good
(I'm nice right now)
Hold up
That D'USSÃ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you[Beyonce]
So what are you going to say at my funeral now that you killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life whose heart I broke
Without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead
Rest in peace my true love who I took for granted
The most bomb pussy who because of me sleep evaded
Her shroud is loneliness
Her god was listening
Her heaven will be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes
Dust to sidechicks
