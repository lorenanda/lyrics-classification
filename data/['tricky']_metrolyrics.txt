Were inseminatin the east end
Were not teasin
Pretend the gasoline went
In the very ground between them
We bout money
Why? 
To keep firm
When they cant go talk
Their God will police them
Thats we inside for assault
We live in our world with the helicopter
Mind sent around to get a robber
Who knows what the hell a cop does
Street dog, i hate them police
Wanna see me and hiv
One ho
Or one with scrubs
Plus wanna do my girls for drugs
Frontin with all the right real come on
Dont even say what a lady does
Look as to think Im turnin out
With a word at last to run em out
Industry- everything under control
None of em know who runnin the show
With the guns and the hos
All of them know
When they come to the door Im on a roll
Nigga with the jungle heights could flow
With the hos in the role for the video
In a great porn show with the flyest girls
Buy and sell with the clientele
Before we all fry in hell
Please dont even try it now
Well do you suppose my pocket well
Nickel, dime- a five bag sale
Me and my kind use
I aint well
Things they try then die jail
Gonna be fast when the high speeds
Are a finished scheme
Our hope I dont see riots
This day is a laugh
Me a star
Aint tryin to see no fuckin police cars
Thats the only drawback when I drive
Slide on our side for a fast ride
Theyll be tryin to move on my side
Got to tell about it before they caught fireTricky:To the Bom Bom Diggy

Whoa, leave us in emotional peace
Mmm, take a walk take a rest, and taste the restDon't wanna be on top of your list,

Spliff in the ashtray
Red stripe I pull the lid
Her touch tickles, especially when she's gentle
But I don't hear words cos I saw the instrumental
Keep the girl at a distance, could lose her very easy
No sunshine in my life
The way I deal is shady3d
Skip hip data to get the anti-matter
Blue lines are the reason why the temple had to shatter
To the sound of silence surrounded by the mass
Her face is on the paper
Not the strangers that I pass
The ones that looking back to see if they are looking back at meDaddy g
Are you predator or do you fear me?3d
-you wanna do a medicinal?
The place I really wanna go
The one I love but never gets near meTricky
I'ts a beautiful day, well it seems as such
Beautiful thoughts means I dream too much
Even if I told you, you still would not know me
Tricky never does
Adrian also gets lonely
How we live in this existence, just be
English upbringing
Background carribean3dSharing a soliliquy
We cut the vocal drop the flexability
Walk a temper 'cause I'm rated comatose
No sunshine in my life cos the way I deal is hazy
Life from day to dazey cos I'm on my toes
Mi chiamo 3d, si, e sono ingleseTricky
It's a looking glass she's looking through
She hated me, but then she loved me too
I'd lie not try so I lost faith
They turn to her to keep the faith
She told me "take an occupation or you lose you're mind"
And on a 9 to 5 lemon, looking for the lime3d
Box clever, watch your sister come together
Crazy weather at the end of my tetherDaddy g
Massive in the area
Murderer
Attack are in the area
Murderer3d
Some go softly softly when I have a tat
Ratchet in the right hand
They got the one to stab it at
Take a walk billy, don't be a hero
Effort's are minimal they're almost at zero
Excommunicated from the brotherhood of man
To wander lonely as a puzzled anagramCarve me blue, green ? brumma? and zinc
Take it to extremities with purple and pink
I feel the colours fill my room beneath the patter of the rain
I can't stand the drops they're dripping down my windowpane
They wash away my shadow and don't even leave a spark upon my soul
They leave the rainbows in the darkTricky
Blues get big, massive are even larger
Save no space into the tricky tardis
Withdraw what I saw from down in darris hall
People laying their claim
In stormy weather it's rain3d
But you're living on a see-sawTricky
I try to see more3d
Somebody died. did he?
No body
Walking on sunshine, but still we're treading water
The son of many reasons searching for the daughter
Seeking knowledge, not acknowledging the jetset
Sample babies soft sounds in my budakon headset
The solar system watches in wisdom
The children dance as the moonlight kissed themTricky
Massive attack not black up here or where I be
Two hours traveling so I wrote this on my feet
Always living fast, people getting jumpy
Where on ? gruggy? falls I do the walter crumpy
Microphones held close, crouching far apart
Take my piece of mind and sign my name across your heart.She's got a wiggle when she walk
A giggle when she talk
She's close to God
I dribble like a dogShe's my Palestine girl
My Palestine baby
She drive me crazy
Sun make me lazyI take a trip to Gaza
It's love I'm really after
She tells me happy be (?)
We walk happily
Haven't seen her lately
I worry 'bout her safetyI take a trip to Gaza
It's really love I'm afterTricky & Blue Daisy:
She's trapped in Babylon
I tell her that I won't be long
Blue Daisy:
Imprisoned in Babylon
The city of sin
A state of mind ...
It's so fucking frightening
Its demons are out
To run their course
A living corpse
Dead to achy feeling (?)
... course
... hungry horse
Or no ...
Unresting feeling
No rest for the wicked
... pace of ...
But to them she's creeping
Through the night is sleepingI take a trip to Gaza
It's really love I'm after
Blue Daisy & Tricky:
She's trapped in Babylon
I tell her that I won't be long
(repreated)It bothers me, it bites me, stings me, deprives me
Off my track, the ways you make me pass, by highways
I am forced to trust your wicked ways
You use me, abuse me, control me, but...
Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters,
This broken heart's a shatter
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love meIn my mind I have killed you, long ago
Born pretender, spirit high jacker, you killed my love for you
Innocent blood, excuse me now, Mr. Right, knight tell me
Stuck in a days, can't even understand no more,Well, Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters,
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love meBorn pretender, spirit high jacker, in the name of love
You heart snatcher, backbiter,
yes they are partakers of sucking innocent blood,
nights walking vampires, excuse me now
duce me to your industry
'cause with me you will definitely go very far,
stuck in a daze, can't even understand unknowingly
Approaching the world through a vivid glance
But it concerns me, and it concern us, yet it condemns us
For this is the fact, the truth and it will forever hunt us but...Nothing really matter, Nothing really matters,
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something is the matter, when love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter... So you must love meTell her try her best just to make it quick
Woman tend to the sick
'Cause there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of GregoryNight nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah thirst
My night nurse, oh gosh

I hurt my loveAnd I'm sure
No doctor can cure

Echoes to see
On an unsuggested stream, unsuggested mean
Take it to the top, unstable the times
Unstable the walk
Unbearable, searable, popular demand
From cradle to grave is Abel buried a man

Would you like to see me a for real winner?

Don't wanna ask twice
Wanna break those chains

Wanna be good
Wanna be a homeboy from the hood
Pretend I'm from America

Your preaching that you care
Do you careI'll fix to fall through time

Captured by what I lose
That' when I forced the flew
Being will never be

Tuck your hair behind you ears
Your tears and your silly fears

Ah
We move like cagey tigers

We couldn't get closer than this

The way we stalk
The way we kissWe slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and brighter
Wider and lighter
Bigger and brighter
Wider and lighterInto the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecatsWe're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dreamInto the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We missed you hissed the lovecatsUnfortunately, we are not authorized to show these lyricsDance with dark hearts
And big stars
Nicotine love
I'll kick you to the tar
I'm river running far
I drive you to the stars
And we fall from above
You feel when I sing
'cause I bring love
'cause I bring love
Nicotine loveAnd when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not around
And when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not aroundYou can walk hard
And talk fast
Take it too far
I'm clicking to the bar
You can jump in your car
You won't get very far
They don't need to be near
They can see where you are
I bring love
I bring love
Nicotine loveAnd when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not around
And when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not aroundAnd when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not around
And when you speak out they shoot you down
Where are all the good men they're not aroundWe were in love for just a second
You leave me with all those questions
That lead me to no directionWas it just me?
You're all that I'd ever wished
You decide what it is
And let my heart sink
You decide what it is
Left me no choice to speakI didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mindHow does it feel like to be so heartless?
Why are you breaking me for no reason?
Don't you know there are things I never learned
Teach me how to read your sign languageOnly if I knew...
Why would I want it from you?
What kind of man loved me to no end?I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mindOnly if I knew
What I wanted from you
I can't go back there
I've done it againI didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mind
I didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
It's funny how things played out in your mindI didn't know that kiss meant good-bye
Oh if I knew...I stand firm for our soil
(A source)
Lick a rock on foil
(Nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me
(They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in ecstasyHell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
(Been livin' on a study)
If you believe or deceive
Common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my lifeAnd when you walk
Do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take furthur evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge
(Shrug)
So judge me for labourThe bond on me ensures my good behavior
(Lobotomy)
The constant struggle ensures my insanity
(Strum)
Passing the ignorance ensures
The struggle for my family
We're hungry beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight
The kill which I share with my passengers
We take our fill, take our fill, take our fillI stand firm for our soil
(A source)
Lick a rock on foil
(Nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me
(They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in ecstasyConfused by different memories
Details of Asian remedies
Conversations, of what's become of enemies
My brain thinks bomb like
So I listen he's a calm type
As I grow and as I grow, I grow collective
Before the move sit on the perspectiveMr. Quaye
(Mr. Kray)
Lay in the crevice
(Distant cradle in the crevice)
And watches from the precipice
Empirial passage
Heat from the sun somedays slowly passes
Until then, you have to live with yourself
Until then, you have to live with yourselfI stand firm for our soil
(A source)
Lick a rock on foil
(Nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me
(They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in ecstasyHell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
If you believe or deceive
Then common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridorsMy brain thinks bomb like, bomb like
My brain thinks bomb like
My brain thinks bomb like
Beware of our appetitefuck you in,
tuck you in,
suck you in"then you fly,
fly as fast as you can to baby jesus"
(sample from film "the rapture")I am she,
mistakes of men,
Gritty teeth,
fists all clenched,
Breast stroke,
lots of touching,
See you in the sauna
There'll be big fun up at my
Hotel, motel, hotel, motelI fuck you in the ass,
just for a laugh,
With the quick speed,
I'll make your nose bleed,
I ride the pre-menstrual cycle,
Forget about Michael,
Now here's the big blast,
I like the big catch,
I'll spray you straight through,
I spray your daydreamsEnjoy myself,
within myself,
And back again, encouraging sin,
a powerful mind,
Devious mind for a devious kind,
Ugly noises and strange ways by the two praiseI roll up the blue bills,
I snort the cheap thrillsIt's too good
It's too nice
She makes me finish too quick
Is it love?
No, not love
She turns my sexual trick
She says she's mine
I know she lies
First, I scream
Then I cry
Take a second of me
You beckon, I bleed
She suffocates me
She suffocates me with suggestion
I ask, do you feel the same?
And later on, maybe
I'll tell you my real name
She's so good
She's so bad
You understand
I can't stand
Now I could just kill a man
She's on her knees
I say please
I cross her city lines
She's got brown eyesI think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know whyForgive and you're forgiven
Kingdom come
Can you wait for yours
I need to taste some
Life's really funny
I laugh while she spends my money
She's my freak
I guess I'm weak
You ask what is this?
Mind your business
I pass idle days
With my idle ways
'Til the twelfth of always
She roams my hallways
I keep her warm
But we never kiss
She cuts my slender wrists
Let's waste some more time
I sign the dotted line
A different level
She-devilI think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know whyYou ask what is this?
Mind your business
I pass idle days
With my idle ways
'Til the twelfth of always
She roams my hallways
I keep her warm
But we never kissShe says I'm weak and immature
But it's cool
I know what money's for
Push comes to shove
Her tongue's her favourite weapon, attack
I slap her back, she mostly hates meI think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know whyCan I take off your clothes
Before we go out
And we'll lay helpless
And scream and shout
We finish everyday
Well, anyway
Sixty-nine degrees
My head's between your knees
You ask what is this?
Mind your businessIt's too good
It's too nice
She makes me finish too quick
Is it love?
No, not love
She turns my sexual trick
She says she's mine
I know she lies
First, I scream
Then I cry
Take a second of me
You beckon, I bleed
Take a second of meI think ahead of you, I think instead of you
Will you spend your life with me and stifle me?
I know why the caged bird sings, I know why
I know why the caged bird sings, I know whyTipico

Hangin' around with girl who's rolling up her jeans
She watches her street cred 'cause she's no dummy
Saw rockin the microphone and now she's calling me a honey
Says I know what I want don't move with thugs
We're house parties hip hop and smoking drugs
And whoever's been the boss she's down with 'em
She's always on time 'cause the girl got rhythm
To avoid all complications i'll give some information
About a certain location under Paddington Station
'Cause when I host my show-a I avoid the girl called lola
Who's more pu-pu-public than the drink they call it coca cola
I'm just practice posing face is shaded in black
Is dominating as my color the massive attack
Right now i hit it kick it flow smooth hit middle wicketTrickyI take a small step now it's a giant stride
People say I'm loud why should I hide
Only had a small taste so what a waste
I quietly observe though it's not my space
Bottom end's heavy you know we're never even
People call me Tricky for particular reason
I've got you see and I've got to let you know
See we're rockin' in your area rock beneath your balcony
My baby just cares for me well that's funny
Her touch tickles especially on my tummyDaddy GNow who's got the microphoneTrickyNow who's honeyDaddy GA turbo turbo and chant with a charge
Addy, Daddy G wild bunch crew at large
Don't call me an officer just call me a sarge
Mashing up the country planning also abroad
Plan to go to America when I get a visa cardTrickyBut gettin' a visa card nowadays isn't hardDaddy GSo keep your ears glued listen to every chord
Tokyo city's one place that we toured
Four technic plus two mixer board
Sharper than a Wilkinson razor sword3DWhen I was a child I played subbuteo on
My table then I graduate to studio one
'Cos D's my nom de plume you know but 3's my pseudonym
And around my neck you know I wear the sony budokan
Indigo blues you got me in my own shoes
The people dancing in the shape for what they make
They can't lose
Yes waxing lyrical but this time it's not satirical
It's kinda spherical so jam me in a ???
This is the miracle of the dubplate dub selectionDaddy GSo whether you're black white or half-caste in your complection3DYes pull out your phono plug and tuck you in your phony
It's started by marconi resumed by sony

I'm jamaican on your radio station
Got a curse in
Could be worse in
You first
In a hearse in
Good as dead in
Nothing left in
Nothing left in
Some be heading
I need a head rest in
And a feed from a warm breast
A man making hits
With my child-bearing hips
Underground like
Who's it sound like
You all sound the same
But you don't know my nameI believe in people lying
I believe in people dying
I believe in people trying
I believe in people crying
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people beingWe all sound the same
You don't know my name
Rearrange and
Things don't change
Things remain
Feel the strain
Stress
Catch my breath

Get some rest

From the mess
(In fact any time)
I couldn't care less
(Every day)
Sugar cane
(Write fictional stories)
Is like smack to my vein
Shook fame
(If you want to)
But I don't complain
(On the street)I believe in different reasons
I believe in breath through seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall
I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running
Keep living
Keep livingYou gotta ask
(There'll be a new tale of)
Before he attacks
(He and I)
You got the flats
(In fact any time)
Dub my sacks
(Every day)
You've got the city
(Writing fictional stories)
Move out of the country
I'm scrunching
(If you want to)
Friends that are punchy
(On the street)I believe in people falling
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being
Keep living(X6)Over me

...Is That Your Life Lyrics
Tricky
Pick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring, bring a gun
What you need, we can serve
Want that money, we reserve
We want that car, we want that house
Informer boy, shut your mouth
I lost my boy, I lost my friend
Got locked down, give him ten
My brothers gone, back in again
My cousins gone and shot my friend
Pick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring bring a gunIs that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one life
Easy boy, I cut your throat
Smoke that weed, snort the coke
I got caught up, I caught a case
You can't hide, you're not safe
I drive my Porsche, I can't slow down
What's that sound, up on the town
Bring the keys make sure you're armed
Here's the code, switch the alarm
Tie that guy, don't let him breath
On the ground, you can't leavePick up my weed and bring it come
Take what you need
Bring, bring a gunIs that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one life
Take what I want, take what I need
Best believe, I feed my greed
Better to take kerosene (?)
You take a break, you drink champagne
You touch a bird, you keep your word (?)
You touch a bird, you keep your word (?)Is that your, is that your
Is that your life
Think before, think before
You got one lifeTricky:
Again, we go 'round and round
I'll get the drinks
I guess it's always my roundAlex Mills:

You stare, you stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again
(repeated)Alex Mills:
Ah piss offDoes it make you feel good
Make you feel hood
Can I fall for your veins
Can you fall from the sky
Will you leave me and die
Will you come back again
Will you meet me at termWhere are the protesters
The slogans insane
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be coddled in love
I wouldn't be coddled in loveWill you fight for a cause
Will you break all the law
Will you come back again
Remember by when
Are you living free
Are you living in me
Does it make you feel good
Make you feel hoodWhere are the protesters
The slogans insane
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be coddled in love
I wouldn't be coddled in loveWhere are the protesters
The slogans insane
This will be a swift decline
I wouldn't be coddled in love
I wouldn't be coddled in love(There's) too many people, too many dying
Too many lying, too many crying(There's) too many voices, so little choices
At night I lie awake, feels like heartacheFeels like heartache, how long will the night take
How long will the night take, it feels like heartacheThe night has come, they say I rise crime rate
[?] can't waitI rise my fist the thunder break through
Make a wish who will you run to(There's) too many prisons taking away from family
Too many reasons to lose your sanityI lie awake and let the visions take me
Think of life and how it tried to break meHad no choice, had to settle
Hear a voice now they burn from metalThere's too many shouts and they call it treason
Can't relate and hate without reason(There's) too many guns, pray for God to come quick
He doesn't come, my God is real sickYou saw my sun down
She makes me run wild
Where's the fun now?
Where's the fun now?And I full run down
She breaks the love town
I feel the real now
She says I'm too proudKeep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sunWhere you found out
is when you talk loud
Don't want to put you down
if you remind now
Can see you fade out
Why want you stay now
shadow cost down
You didn't heave on the groundKeep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sunYou saw my sun down
She makes me run wild
Where's the fun now?
Where's the fun now?And I full run down
She breaks the love town
I feel the real now
She says I'm too proudKeep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sunFor world, for someone
For him, for she
For world, for someone
For him, for meYour eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hearSo this is the aftermathYour eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people's plan
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be near
So many things I need to tell youFor world, for someone

(bjork-ese till end)This is a matter of utmost urgency
You might even call it a police emergency
Suckers got ill when they finally heard the G
Wasn't sellin' out, they tried to murder me
Reached for my jammy like a troop's supposed to do
Never let a sucker get too close to you
Heard 'em comin', ducked behind the wall
Then saw the whites of his eyes, the first one had to fall
Another bug creeped up the fire escape
Trying to sneak, I guess he snuck too late
Lookin' like a scene from Real Life Vice
The way his head fell apart like a block of solid ice
Uzi does it, come to think of it
Dude had a nine, but his wasn't as fast as mine
I heard the phone ring, should I answer?
This is gettin' serious as terminal cancer
And that is the final stage, my primal rage
Began to rise and I started to fantasize
How many more might try to rush the door
And blast their way in, hell, I ain't stayin'
I opened the back door and felt the summer night heat
Saw a bunch of bugs wearin' white sheets
What else could it mean? I know it ain't Halloween
The cross in the background burnin' made a ill scene
First I was panicky, then I was angry
One creep even had a rope ready to hang me
Now who am I supposed to be? Eddie Spaghetti?
You come and vic Rob G any time you're ready?
Fuck that, they had me trapped so I rushed back
They tried to bust me but they don't have enough caps
I dipped, dived, slipped, slid, they missed me
I had to move quick or they was bound to get me
One bullet grazed me, that didn't phase me
What could I say? I was havin' a fucked up day
Stood up and took aim, my finger on the trigger
I shouted 'Now let me hear you say nigger!'
Well anyway, nobody spoke or went for broke
The place was all clouded up from gunsmoke
And everything got quiet, I don't buy it
Just a second ago we had a riot
They must be plannin' attack or settin' a trap
Whatever the case you won't get this black
Now I'm on the edge and there's no denyin' it
Whatever the hell might work I'm tryin' it
Thought I was a target that they could get right quick
But I ain't goin' out like no statistic
Another number, made me wonder
How many other brothers they've put under
I sat in the dark real still for a long time
Didn't make a sound cos I've got a strong mind
Made my way to the street, it was daybreak
Must've fallen asleep, but for Pete's sake
I didn't see the enemy trying to put an end to me
The night before, my finger trigger was sore
I went in the house to get a fresh clip
And then I woke up an' shit
It's just a bad dreamShe makes me wanna die
Follow where Mary goes
Cherish the things she knows
Says if I change my strideThen I'll fly
She makes me wanna die
And change my stride
Then I'll flyLook to the sun
See me in psychic pollution
Walking on the moon
And how could you dare?Who do you think you are?
You're insignificant
A small piece, an ism
No more, no lessYou try to learn the universe
And can't even converse in universe
You know it's ironic
Smoking hydroponicShe makes me wanna die
And change my stride
Then I'll flyShe makes me wanna die

You knowWhat you gonna do with your sex drive?
Wait for your soul to catch up with me
Concretely seen
I talk to him
I wanna lie
She looks at me
I wanna hide
Wanna be rich and fat
How do I validate that?
I think every time to fluid
I cut my mouth...
Do I, returning into there
Can I rest my head on your chest and dribble
You know the rules I speaks in riddle
Pain is somewhere along the line(2x)
It takes courage and strength to be single
When you get older your body won't look so good
This is the peak, the best time for a relationship
I'm the only shiek in moscow
I said if you're in love let go my hand now
The older I get the more confused I am
The older I get the more bitter I am
Damn it jesus
They want more more pleasure more Regis
I sway one way with my head down
I don't wanna get a conflicting mind state
You hold the national wealth
I get the, I get the national health
You told me I was the original guttersnipe
But really I'm the original isrealite
I live in a ghetto forever after
So you manufacture the ghetto blaster
But I'm out now, I'm older
Don't carry music on my shoulder
You think I'm a wild terrier
Now I can afford to live in your area...
(Mumbling)
The older I get the more confused I am
The confused I am the older I getMy defenses become fences
I'm stumbling I change my face
And if you think I'm fake up
Wait around till I take off my make-upHere we go again I need another one

Together we can learnWish I was too dead to cry
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my creator
Masochists to which I cater
You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds
Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
my flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying
You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleedsFollow and there it goes,
Cherish I think she knows
'Cause if I change my strike
And I'm fly.And nothing's changed
Feel the same
Is just sure the pace,
Still have the same.Nothing's changed,
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.Follow and there it goes.
Cherish I think she knows
Says if I change my straight
And I'm fly.Change my stright
Don't think I've tried?
I was born to give
Streets calling.Nothing's changed
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.Nothing's changed.
I still feel the same.
Nothing's changed.
I still heard the same.Nothing's changed,
Feel the same.
Nothing's changed,
I still feel the same.I realize, there's no compromise
Through lying eyes, my love for
Just wasn't there, even though I care
Did I hurt you bad, did I make you sadI know I paid, that's why I'm alone today
Just me myself, no mental health
My mistake overtakes
Your love's overgrown my loveMy love, my love, my love for you
My love, my love, my love for youNow I wonder why, until we die
And then upon the praise
Hope Jesus come to kill the man / mourn (?)
I feel again, I love you then
Oceans of time, a cross divine
I found you, I will find you
That is not my time, my time to take
