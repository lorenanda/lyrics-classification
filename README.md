# Predicting the artist from web-scraped music lyrics

This project was completed in week 4 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

The **goal** is to build a web-scraper to scrape music lyrics, preprocess the obtained text, then build a Naive-Bayes Classifier to predict the artist from the lyrics.

## Data
First, I scraped lyrics of Metallica and Iron Maiden from [lyrics.com](www.lyrics.com) and built a Naive Bayes Classifier that predicted the artist from lyrics with a 70% accuracy.
