# Predicting the artist from web-scraped music lyrics

This project was completed in week 4 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

The **goal** is to build a web-scraper to scrape music lyrics, preprocess the obtained text, then build a Naive-Bayes Classifier to predict the artist from the lyrics.

## Data
I scraped the lyrics of Metallica and Iron Maiden from [lyrics.com](www.lyrics.com). I chose these two bands because I like their music, they have a large discography (which is always good for machine learning), and (most importantly) I wanted to analyze their lyrics and show why Iron Maiden are superior to Metallica (at least linguistically).
