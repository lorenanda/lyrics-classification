# Predicting the artist from web-scraped music lyrics

This project was completed in week 4 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

The **goal** is to build a web-scraper to scrape music lyrics, preprocess the obtained text, then build a Naive-Bayes Classifier to predict the artist from the lyrics.

## Results
The built web-scraper scraped around 100 song lyrics of Metallica and Iron Maiden from [lyrics.com](www.lyrics.com). I used this text data to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, which predicted the artist from lyrics with 68% accuracy.
